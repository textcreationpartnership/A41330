            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Reverend, and my much Honoured Brother, Dr.</hi> Edward Stillingfleet, <hi>Dean of St.</hi> Pauls.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope it is no offence unto you, though you be a <hi>Dean,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Unreaſ. Separat. p. 62.</note> that I call you <hi>Brother,</hi> ſince you have taught the Preſs how to ſpeak ſoberly and amicably, calling us <hi>Diſſenting Brethren;</hi> this is better language than <hi>Sots, Rogues, Fools, Knaves, Rebels, Schiſmaticks,</hi> which we read and hear from others. As for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> if they be all Rebels that break the Kings Laws, I believe the King will have but a few loyal ſubjects. He hath Laws againſt <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Swearing, Whoring, Sabbath breaking,</hi> and theſe are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of God, (beſides Laws about Hares, Partridges, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and againſt <hi>Papiſts, &amp;c.</hi>) we ſee men can live in oppoſition to theſe Laws, yet theſe are not called <hi>Rebels.</hi> But if the Laws of men concern the Houſe and Worſhip of God, concerning which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath given us his own Laws, to which all Princes and men are bound, and unto which all their Laws ought to be conformable, (as we ſhall hear your ſelf ſpeak preſently) but that conformity we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, and therefore dare not aſſent and conſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now we are called <hi>Rebels, Schiſmaticks,</hi> and what not?
<note place="margin">Aug. Epiſ. 119.</note> Thus it was in pious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> time, and this he complains of.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſpeaking of your Church, you tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 302. <hi>Our Church is founded upon a Divine Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>the Holy Scriptures, which we own as the baſis and foundation of our faith; and according to which all other Rules of Order and Worſhip are to be agreeable.</hi> 2ly. <hi>Our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a conformity to thoſe Rules which are appointed by it agreeable to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twice you tell us, <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Word of God; to which we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree alſo, this being the affirmative part of the ſecond Commandment, that all things in our worſhipping of him, be agreeable to his will and word.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> had you proved that all the things impoſed upon us had been <hi>agreeable to the word of God,</hi> you had put an end to this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. But though I honour and love you for the great ſervice you have done to the Church of Chriſt againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet in proving the things Impoſed upon <hi>us</hi> to be <hi>conformable</hi> to the word of God, I
<pb facs="tcp:98093:3"/>humbly conceive you fall very ſhort, therefore are we ſtill <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> Several things are impoſed upon us, but in your whole Book I find not <hi>one</hi> Scripture you produce to ſhew the agreement of them with it. Till then, our Separation is <hi>reaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a great ſin, I agree with you, and wiſh Chriſtians were more convinced of it than I ſee they are. But the Queſtions are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is ſchiſm?</hi> 2. <hi>Who is the cauſe of ſchiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt:</hi> Sir, I preſume you will grant that the <hi>ſeparation</hi> againſt which you preached, and now printed, do ſuppoſe, there was a union with that body from which you tell us we are now ſeparated. For how can there be a ſeparation from that to which we were not united?</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I think by what you have ſaid, to remove the <hi>mighty ſtumbling-block</hi> (as you call it, <hi>pag.</hi> 359.) of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> there will be found many thouſands in <hi>England</hi> who were never admitted into your Church, and if not admitted into it, then not united to it as <hi>ſuch</hi> a Church; no members of your body: how then can you charge them with this ſin of <hi>ſeparation</hi> from it?</p>
            <p>Thus then, Sir, you ſpeak of the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> p. 351. when the Miniſter uſes theſe words. <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>We receive this child into the congregation of Chriſts flock, and ſign him with the ſign of the Croſs, &amp;c.</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter now ſpeaks in the name of the Church, <hi>We receive, &amp;c.</hi> then follows <hi>as the ſolemn rite of admiſſion, and do ſign him with the ſign of the Croſs.</hi> All publick and ſolemn admiſſions into ſocieties, having ſome peculiar <hi>ceremony</hi> belonging to them. And ſo as Baptiſm, beſides its Sacramental efficacy, is a rite of admiſſion into Chriſts Catholick Church, <hi>ſo the ſign of the Croſs is into our Church of England,</hi> in which this Ceremony is uſed, without any preſcription to other Churches.</q> Thus you have interpreted the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this will ſatisfie <hi>Mr. B.</hi> I leave it to him, it doth not me; the <hi>Impoſers</hi> of that Ceremony in their <hi>Canons,</hi> do not tell us that it is the <hi>Rite of admiſſion into your Church</hi> but <hi>by this ceremony the Infant is dedicated to the ſervice of him that died upon the Croſs.</hi> And that Book being of publick authority, muſt carry it.</p>
            <p>I had thought that in our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we had been <hi>Dedicated to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit.</hi> But it ſeems this is not enough, you annex to <hi>his</hi> words, <hi>Another ſign to dedicate us to the ſervice of Chriſt that died upon the Croſs.</hi> This, Sir, I hope you will prove to be <hi>agreeable to the word of God,</hi> as you told us, <hi>your Impoſitions are.</hi> I am very ignorant of the Text that proves it, and you have named none.</p>
            <p>But this is not the thing I aim at; it is <hi>your</hi> interpretation I mind, and from it I gather, that you and all others who charge us with ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:98093:3"/>from your Church, muſt prove, <hi>That we were received, and that by this rite of admiſſion</hi> (the Croſs) <hi>into your Church, which you call the Church of England.</hi> This is clear from your own Interpretation, and alſo from the <hi>page</hi> before 350, where you illuſtrate it from the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Churches; Thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>an adult perſon to be baptized, and immediately after Baptiſm to be admitted a member of an</hi> Independent Church, <hi>and the ceremony of this admiſſion to be,</hi> holding up of the hand, <hi>in token of his owning the</hi> Church-Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, let me ſuppoſe (as you do ſuppoſe) that the Paſtors of the <hi>Independent</hi> Churches ſhould baptize ſeveral perſons, but never admit them into their Churches, by this <hi>ceremony of holding up the hand;</hi> let them baptize many thouſands, and theſe thouſands chuſe other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors who are rightly qualified, and ordained by Prayer, Faſting, and Impoſition of hands of the Elderſhip: The <hi>Independents</hi> cannot charge theſe Churches with <hi>ſchiſm,</hi> and <hi>ſeparation</hi> from their Churches, for they never admitted them by that <hi>ceremony and rite of Admiſſion,</hi> of <hi>holding up the hand</hi> into their Churches.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, apply it; for about twenty years there was publick Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm adminiſtred, but not by your Liturgy, much leſs with the <hi>Croſs.</hi> How many thouſands do you think in the ſpace of ſo many years may be baptized, none of theſe were ever admitted into your Church by thoſe words, <hi>VVe receive this child, &amp;c. and ſign him with the ſign of the croſs.</hi> But of many ſuch do our Congregations conſiſt, who were never <hi>your members;</hi> why then do you call them <hi>ſeparatiſts</hi> from you?</p>
            <p>Beſides, Sir, your Liturgy admits of <hi>private Baptiſm,</hi> and then no ſuch admiſſion by the Croſs, and abundance have been thus baptized without it, to my knowledg.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, I cannot tell whither I was ſo admitted, my Parents never told me ſo; and for my godly Father I am ſure he hated humane inventions in the Worſhip of God. I was born, they told me, in winter time, extream for cold, the houſe half a mile from Church, and I being their only Son at that time, it's a queſtion whether they would carry me forth in ſuch an extream cold ſeaſon ſo far. As for the <hi>Church-Regiſter,</hi> that (nor any other that ever I ſaw) ſpecifies nothing of my being <hi>admitted into your Church by the Croſs;</hi> but only of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized; but that ſay you, (and truly) is into the Catholick Church. No <hi>Regiſters</hi> then recording, who were ſo admitted, it will be hard matter for theſe who are ancient to prove their admiſſion into your Church, and if we were not, I know not how we can now be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For this <hi>Rite of Admiſſion</hi> is uſed only at <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> unleſs we will yield to be <hi>Rebaptized</hi> and ſo to be admitted by the <hi>Croſs,</hi> this you will not admit no more than we.</p>

            <p>We read of the Apoſtles admitting of many believers, <hi>God added to the Church,</hi> Act. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> but never that they uſed this rite of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>the ſign of the Croſs;</hi> only this is our happineſs, we are more wife, more holy, greater lovers of Chriſt, than ever the Apoſtles were, (though we profeſs we are <hi>built upon the foundation of Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20.) that their examples are too low for us.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Sir, is it not meet that when children come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion they ſhould then be called before the Church to declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they own their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> and alſo their <hi>admiſſion into the Church</hi> they are reputed members of, as you ſay, the <hi>Independents</hi> require their Children to own the <hi>Church-Covenant?</hi> let them now be members of the Church by their <hi>own conſent.</hi> Truly, Sir, if it come to that, ſince we read what your <hi>Canons</hi> ſay of the Croſs, and how it is abuſed in <hi>Popery,</hi> and how ſtrange this is to the <hi>Apoſtolical admiſſion,</hi> we ſhould not like it.</p>
            <p>But are not children members of the ſame Churches with their Parents? though we think ſo, yet this is nothing to the practiſe of your Church. For as in your adminiſtration of Baptiſm, the <hi>Parental Covenant, (Abraham</hi> and his ſeed) which is the ground of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, is wholly omitted; ſo the <hi>Parent</hi> he muſt ſtand by as if he were a Heathen; the buſineſs is only with the <hi>God fathers,</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers,</hi> an invention of <hi>Higinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about 144 years after Chriſt, who firſt added theſe to Baptiſm; a perſon of no great worth, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Nihil praclari, de gubernatione, &amp; factis ejus commemorari poteſt.</hi> So much cauſe have I to beg pardon for my defects in the education of my own Children, that I would not be <hi>Sponſor</hi> for the child of the beſt friend I have in <hi>England.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this is not it, but the <hi>ſign of the Croſs, with ſuch words,</hi> that makes the admiſſion into your Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Q.</hi> But if there be a Separation, or Schiſm, the queſtion is, who is the cauſe of it?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Schiſm muſt needs be theirs, whoſe the cauſe of it is,</hi> ſaith Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Land,</hi> in which you juſtifie him, <hi>Ration. Account,</hi> p. 324, 325.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive, that whoever impoſes other terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Chriſt hath impoſed, he or they are the cauſe of the <hi>ſchiſm. We do not,</hi> ſay you, <hi>neceſſarily ſeparate from all Churches that have errors or corruptions in them, ſuppoſing thoſe errors and corruptions be not impoſed on us as conditions of communion,</hi> Ibid. p. 332.</p>
            <p>I pray do not think that we ſuppoſe you impoſe ſuch groſs things upon us, as <hi>Rome</hi> impoſed on you: No, Sir, we bleſs God for that great advance which was made by our firſt Reformers. But whereas
<pb facs="tcp:98093:4"/>you ſay you retain only ſuch innocent Ceremonies which were in uſe before the Papal power grew to that height:</p>
            <p>I pray, <hi>firſt,</hi> are you ſure that <hi>All</hi> the Churches did uſe them? 2. Did they uſe <hi>all</hi> that are impoſed on us? I know they uſed others; but did they uſe to tye up their Miniſters to ſuch ſyllables in prayer, or elſe muſt not pray? Did they kneel at the Lords Supper? we know the contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Did they <hi>impoſe</hi> theſe as conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? But grant there were ſuch Ceremonies, and other things as now impoſed upon us, I will ſay of them,

            <p>And I pray, Sir, ſince the examples and practiſes of thoſe Churches, are made ſo much uſe of againſt us, let me give you my thoughts in a ſimilitude of your own.</p>
            <p>In your Epiſtle to your <hi>Rational Account, &amp;c.</hi> dedicated to the King, you tell his Majeſty, <hi>that the Church of England in the late confuſions ſuffered an Eclipſe, but ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration ſhe hath recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her luſter, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, we obſerve when the Sun riſeth, it doth not ſuddenly go into an Eclipſe, but gradually, ſo that common people do not mind it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the light of it be ſenſibly obſcured; ſo, nor doth it come out of its Eclipſe ſuddenly at once, but gradually; but it will not ceaſe its motion till it appears in its glory. It is the ſame with the Goſpel-Church, it did not preſently, ſuddenly fall into that dark Eclipſe, which it ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Antichriſtian Papal power, but it got into it by degrees, the Churches not diſcerning it; <hi>the myſtery of iniquity wrought,</hi> it is no fancy of mine, but the Apoſtles expreſs words. The <hi>ſubtil ſerpent,</hi> he wrought among the Churches under <hi>fair pretences;</hi> in the ſecond Century ſome addition made to <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church; in the third Century more; in the fourth Century more; ſo increaſed the Eclipſe, ſtill under fair reaſons, till the Serpent had got the <hi>man of ſin</hi> into his Throne, and the Prediction fulfilled. So hath the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches coming out of the Eclipſe been but gradual, in <hi>Doctrine, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Worſhip,</hi> by our worthy Reformers; but as the evil ſpirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then, by Gods permiſſion, to bring about the Propheſie; ſo the Spirit of Chriſt in the hearts of our firſt Reformers wrought power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and ſo doth the ſame Spirit <hi>ſtill</hi> work, and <hi>will</hi> work, till the Church be quite out of her Eclipſe, and comes to be ſatisfied with the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Chriſt declared in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; let men call it <hi>ſchiſm, fanaticiſm,</hi> or what they pleaſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98093:5"/>
            <p>But, Sir, you tell us of Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham, Mr. Giffard, &amp;c.</hi> worthy men, (I grant they were ſo, and honour them much) and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, who condemned Separation from your Church, and no more was impoſed than in their time, and this takes up a great part of your Book.</p>
            <p>Sir, while ſome excellent men at home conformed, but groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden, (as I remember Mr. <hi>John Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint, though he did conform, I never ſaw him wear a Surplice, nor heard him uſe but a few prayers, and thoſe I think he ſaid <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter,</hi> not read them; but this he would do in his Preaching, draw his finger about his throat and ſay, <hi>Let them take me and hang me up, ſo they will but remove theſe ſtumbling-blocks out of the Church.</hi>) How many thouſands of choice Chriſtians, plucked up their ſtakes here, forſook their dear friends and native Country, ſhut up themſelves in Ships (to whom a priſon for the time had been more elegible) went remote into a howling Wilderneſs, there underwent great hardſhips, water was their common drink, and glad if they might have had but that which they had given at their doors here (many of them); and all this ſuffering was to avoid your Impoſitions, and that they might dwell in the Houſe of God, and enjoy all things therein according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what cared your Church for this; let Gods people groan at home, ſuffer abroad, they ſhall do it rather than your Church will part with a few <hi>trifles,</hi> as your own Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> calls the <hi>ceremonies.</hi> Sir, is this the ſpirit of the true Spouſe of Chriſt? But as I ſaid, the ſame Spirit will work which acted thoſe holy men, till the Church be totally out of her Eclipſe, what ever thoſe worthy men you mention have ſaid.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak more cloſe, I deny that the ſtate of your Church <hi>now,</hi> is the ſame it was <hi>then,</hi> when theſe worthy men condemned Separation from it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are many thouſands now in <hi>England,</hi> who were never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into <hi>your</hi> Church, were never members of it; then they could not condemn theſe as Separatiſts from it. This I have proved before from your Interpretation of the <hi>ſign of the Croſs.</hi> It was not ſo in their time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Liturgy and the Homilies were <hi>then</hi> brought in out of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>want of gifts;</hi> now it is impoſed in <hi>ſcorn</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>gifts.</hi> By what ſome of your Arch-deacons have ſpoken in your Courts, and others, we can conclude no other, than it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bring over the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to your Church, and for ſeveral years the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did frequent your Divine Service; but now it was impoſed with ſuch words (as in my next) that it was made an engine to turn
<pb facs="tcp:98093:5"/>Proteſtants out of your Church. A Member of that Parliament that made the Act for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> viſiting his Siſter, a Lady (who told it me) related to her what they were about; ſhe diſliked their Act, and told him, <hi>I ſee then you are laying a ſnare in the gate. Ay,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if we can find any way to catch the Rogues, we will have them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Then they were not required to <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent, &amp;c.</hi> but now it is impoſed with theſe terms; and I am confident that divers who have ſubſcribed with theſe terms, do but lye.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis true we have the ſame 39 Articles, that was before; and thoſe Articles were aſſented to, and aſſent required in that Church.
<note place="margin">Rational Account. p. 54, 55.</note> But now <hi>you</hi> have told the world that Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> gives the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> thus: viz. <hi>She does not define any of theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as neceſſary to be believed, &amp;c. Neither do we look upon them as Eſſentials of ſaving faith, &amp;c. Neither do we oblige any man to believe them, but only not to contradict them.</hi> And this is the opinion of the Grandees in <hi>this your</hi> Church; this would have been abhor'd before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As thoſe 39 Articles were believed by that Clergy, ſo they did defend them, and Preached them; but this Clergy can both print and preach againſt them, I mean the great and ſound Doctrines in them, (I do not ſay all of them.) I put the queſtion to one of your Clergy, and asked him in earneſt what he thought <hi>of this Clergy</hi> as to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> contained in theſe Articles? he anſwered me, <hi>Divide them into three parts, he thought two of the three were fallen from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. In that Church there were abundance of godly plain-hearted Miniſters, whoſe Religion was not confined to a Pulpit, but walked among their people as became Miniſters, ſeeking the good of their ſouls. I deny not but God hath ſome ſuch now; but for the generality of them, I ſay nothing my ſelf, only I can tell you what others have ſaid. A learned and pious Divine, ſo far a friend to Conformity, that I doubt not but he hath ſubſcribed; he told me, Though your Church would give him a Living, he would not take it, becauſe he would not have ſuch an occaſion to bring him among your Clergy. And diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with another of your Clergy, (whom for learning, wit and piety, I do honour) about Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s Book, and his Dialect, which you call <hi>uncomely writing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Truly we have ſuch a frothy, vain Clergy, gone off from that ſolidity and gravity that become Divine things, that if Books come not out in this dreſs, they will but ſcorn them; but in that Book, beſides wit, there is good matter.</hi> Pridentem dicere verum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was his ſenſe of <hi>Mr. A</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>But. Sir, if ſuch as theſe be thruſt upon us, muſt we own them for our <hi>Miniſters?</hi> What, Sir, will you deny the peoples power of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:98093:6"/>which the <hi>Papists</hi> grant the people had till <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, or till <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, about 830 years? See, I pray, <hi>Pamelius</hi> his Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon theſe words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Epiſt. 68. <hi>Quando ipſa (plebs) maxime habeat potestatem vel eligendi dignos ſacerdotes, vel indignos recuſandi.</hi> How could a man write plainer for the peoples power of Election? But our Proteſtants tell us, that only from the time of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the ſecond, who died <hi>Ann.</hi> 1250, or there about, were the people excluded from the power of chuſing Paſtors, and it was the deed of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, as <hi>Krantzius</hi> reporteth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That Church did believe and prove the <hi>Pope, &amp;c.</hi> to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, <hi>Rome-christian</hi> to be the Whore, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. thus the Biſhops, and our Profeſſors of Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I can meet but with very few of <hi>this</hi> Church of that opinion. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> the Oracle of this new Edition of the Clergy, cannot find him in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. nor in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. the Pope is an honeſt man with him. Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> tells us, <hi>Our conteſt is not with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but the Court of</hi> Rome. I find that you have declared: 1. <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church.</hi> 2. <hi>That they retain the fundamentals of Religion.</hi> 3. <hi>That ſalſation is to be had in the Church of Rome.</hi> Lay all together, here is a fair Bridg laid to go over to <hi>Rome.</hi> To ſay, that God hath his people under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Rome,</hi> is one thing, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.4. but to ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, is another thing; a <hi>Wife</hi> and a <hi>Whore</hi> differ.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In <hi>that</hi> Church <hi>Re-ordination</hi> to the ſame office was never heard of, but exploded, as it is in all Churches elſe; but in <hi>this</hi> Church it is impoſed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There was no Oath taken, nor Covenant made with the great God, to reform the Houſe of God, in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> according to the word of God; this ought to be, though the Covenant had not been made; had the things impoſed been according to the Word of God, this Covenant had bound us to them; that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will not be beaten out of the hearts of them, <hi>who know God,</hi> and <hi>fear an Oath,</hi> what ever other perſons make of it; the leaſt then men can do, is to abſtain from thoſe things which were once caſt out, as being unconformable to the word of God; and ſhall thoſe people have no Ordinances for fear of a <hi>ſeparation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In <hi>that</hi> Church, <hi>Quakers</hi> were not known; but under <hi>this</hi> Church they ſwarm, that raze the foundation, and deſtroy all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ordinances. And many people being offenced with your impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſguſted with your Clergy, lay in great danger of being carried away with them; and I doubt not abundance had gone, but that by our Preaching and adminiſtring all Ordinances, they have been
<pb facs="tcp:98093:6"/>kept cloſe to Goſpel truths, Goſpel-ordinances, and Goſpel-miniſtry. The <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> are not ſo hated by your Clergy, as we are.</p>
            <p>From all which I conclude the Cauſe is not the ſame; and had Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham, &amp;c.</hi> been living in our days, they would, I doubt not, have done as we do.</p>
            <p>But then we are charged with bringing in of <hi>Popery,</hi> and this takes up ſeveral leafs of your <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heylin</hi> (one of yours) tells us indeed, <hi>I perſwade my ſelf,
<note place="margin">Geograp. in Quarto Edit. pag 470.</note> had the Reformed party abroad continued an allowable correſpondence in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church, as the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth now, it had been far greater, and leſs ſtomacked; and this was the cenſure of Monſieur</hi> de Rhoſny, <hi>when he obſerved the Majeſty and decency of our Church-ſervice in our Cathedrals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Harding, Briſtow,</hi> and <hi>Carrier,</hi> ſeducing Jeſuits, aſſured themſelves that they might yet convert <hi>England</hi> to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, whoſe Service and Ceremonies ſhe yet retained. Nor do I ſee any ſuch alteration made in this Edition, but if Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th. and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. offered to confirm the former, and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> affirmed they might do it, then the Pope may do this, for ought I know.</p>
            <p>But how do we bring in <hi>Popery?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. p 7.</note> you tell us out of Biſhop <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the firſt way is, <hi>by pulling down Epiſcopacy, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, <hi>Biſhops</hi> are reſtored, and you tell the King the Church of <hi>England</hi> is out of her Eclipſe; that ſhe ſhines in a firmament above her Adverſaries: I pray, Sir, what is the matter that <hi>now</hi> Popery is coming in as a flood upon us? cannot theſe <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Banks, keep it out? I ſay nothing how ſtrongly they act in Parliament againſt it, the Kingdom talk enough of it.</p>
            <p>I pray, Sir, tell us what have you Conformiſts done more againſt Popery than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have done?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Have you prayed earneſtly againſt it? ſo have we.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have you Preached againſt it? ſo have we.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Have you Printed againſt it (as you have done excellently, and we thank you for it) ſo have ours. The firſt Book I ſaw was <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> I ſaw a ſecond Impreſſion, and wondered I heard of no anſwer from your Church; Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> was the man that anſwered it, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1662. ſo long <hi>ours</hi> have appeared.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Have your Clergy kept their monthly Faſts four or five years, foreſeeing what now is coming upon us (if God prevent it not)? ſo have ſeveral of our Miniſters, with the hazard of our Eſtates and Perſons by <hi>Informers,</hi> from whom you were free.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98093:7"/>
            <p n="5">5. Did you the laſt year (at leaſt for the chief part of the year), beſide your family-prayers, ſet a part ſometime between fix and ſeven in the morning one day in the week, to pray purpoſely that God would deliver this Nation from theſe bloody Papiſts, and their curſed Idolatry, and Doctrines? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo have we in ſeveral Counties, and layed the ſame charge on our people.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do you think you ſhall be put to defend our Legal right to the Proteſtant Religion by what I am loth to mention, the ſword)? ſince the <hi>Lollards-Tower,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Cole-houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are out of date, they are too thirſty, and muſt have larger draughts. I believe there will be no diſtinction then between a true Proteſtant Conformiſt, and us, therefore we muſt join with you.</p>
            <p>Why then do you charge us with bringing in of Popery? I deſire your Church would not put us upon temptation; we wrong them not in their Tythes but charge our people to pay them exactly; and do not grudg us the little that we have to bring us in bread. I thank God I am not very lazy in my place, but if you will give me twelve pound <hi>per Annum</hi> for my ſtipend, you ſhall have it, and thank you too. But I bleſs God I may work for ſo good a Maſter.</p>
            <p>A little more as to our Communion with your Church: Sir, ſome of us have lived in Gods Houſe, where we ſaw the Government hath been carried on by Officers of his own appointment, according to his own Rule, and what a <hi>majeſty</hi> have we beheld in it! Admonitions, firſt privately, then publickly by the Elders, continuing in this courſe of admoniſhing, to try if they could bring to repentance, ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter, as the ſin hath been, and they in prudence ſaw reaſons. (I have known them waſte half a year in this courſe) When nothing would do, but they muſt come to <hi>Excommunication,</hi> how wiſely did they govern the Brethren to bring them to declare their conſent
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.6.</note> 
               <hi>obedientially</hi> to their Elders, (for they deny the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be <hi>Democratical;</hi> nor will I own the <hi>Fraternity to be the firſt ſubject of the Keys. In the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> as our Lord ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. and to the beginning we muſt go) and your
<note n="*" place="margin">Primit. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Church. p. 147.</note> 
               <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſpeaks excellently to this, why the Congregation ought to be concern'd in this. Now when all were agreed, how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the ſentence! what pale faces! how many tears did it cauſe in the Congregation! a ſolemn ſight to behold the Church putting the perſon out of the Congregation, <hi>Terrible as an army of banners, Cant.</hi> 6.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I have often thought of the Text ſince. After this, how excellently did the Church walk towards an Excommunicate perſon, to bring to Repentance? And what rare effects have I known of this Ordinance, without any Writs <hi>de Excommunicato capiendo;</hi> alas theſe
<pb facs="tcp:98093:7"/>could never effect what I have known, to the humbling of ſuch a perſon. And now, Sir, do you think that we who have ſeen theſe things, can join with your Church, where this Ordinance ſo <hi>majeſtical,</hi> ſo <hi>terrible,</hi> is ſo horribly profaned? I pray, Sir, pardon me though I ſtand off from it. But I pray, Sir, why do your <hi>Biſhops</hi> excommunicate thoſe who were never of your Church? why do they not Excommunicate the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch?</hi> True, they live under your Laws, but your Law is, they muſt be admitted by the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and being Infants, could not help it.</p>
            <p>As to your Diſcourſe about <hi>particular Congregations,</hi> and <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> it is not my purpoſe to meddle with it; only I deſire you to tell me why a Paſtor of a ſingle Congregation may not be as fit to govern that Congregation, as your ſingle Biſhop to govern a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Congregations, as it is with your Church? where did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ordain, but one ſingle Paſtor to a Church? we have eight Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches recorded in the Epiſtles, and the <hi>Acts,</hi> but we read in them all ſeveral Elders to carry on Church-work. As for <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops in our controverted ſenſe, enough hath been ſaid about them. Strange that we ſhould have twelve Apoſtles beſide <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> many Elders and ſeveral Evangeliſts, and but <hi>two</hi> Biſhops (who were Evangeliſts too) recorded in holy Writ to be the pattern for the ſucceeding Biſhops; when, where, and how, thoſe <hi>two</hi> were made Biſhops, we cannot find.</p>
            <p>And for the large Dioceſſes, ſo large, that 'tis impoſſible for a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> to perform the Duties the Lord requires of a Paſtor to one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Dioceſs:
<note place="margin">Pag. 203</note> The Petitioners for Reformation in King <hi>James</hi>'s reign, tell his Majeſty, That in <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time there were in one Province under <hi>Carthage,</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> Biſhops above nine hundred. Of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> part there were preſent 286, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 120 by reaſon of ſickneſs and old age, Epiſcopal Churches void 60, in all 466. Of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> there were preſent 279, abſent 120, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches void 60, in all 459. Theſe come near the matter, make him but <hi>Epiſcopus praeſes,</hi> and as to Officers and Churches I may come to agree with you, leaving my brethren to their judgments.</p>
            <p>Several other things I took notice of in your Book that may eaſily be anſwered; as the <hi>perplexing ſcruples</hi> you mention, <hi>pag.</hi> 384, 385. <hi>(If we muſt baptize only by the Parents right)</hi> that men muſt run into. No, none at all.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, did you not forget your ſelf very much, <hi>p.</hi> 393. when you tell us the differences between the Popiſh Ceremonies, and your Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? viz. <hi>That yours are appointed only for decency and order?</hi> Sir, do not your Preface to your Ceremonies tell us another ſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:98093:8"/>
               <hi>a ſignificacy in them to put us in mind of our duty?</hi> 2. Of an <hi>aptneſs in them to ſtir up our dull minds to our duty?</hi> Here is ſome <hi>efficacy</hi> in them to help to the performance of duty, ſtirring up dull minds; theſe do not much differ from the <hi>efficacy</hi> you ſay the <hi>Papiſts</hi> give to theirs for the purging <hi>away ſome ſorts of ſins.</hi> I think both alike.</p>
            <p>As for your <hi>French</hi> Letters; who told <hi>le Moyne</hi> what he writes <hi>pag.</hi> 404. <hi>That we believe that a man cannot be ſaved in the Church of England?</hi> I never heard ſuch a word from any Diſſenter, nor ever had I ſuch a thought. Certainly none of our Biſhops would write ſuch a line to him. So that this muſt be the figment of a <hi>French</hi> mans brain, which we abhor; for the ſtory he writes, <hi>p.</hi> 409. of a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> that he heard preach; I could tell him a ſtory of one of our late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ten times worſe, but the Preſs ſhall not know it; but you ſhall.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have given you a few of my thoughts, reading over your Book, while my Papers were in the Preſs, (which have lain by me ſeveral years) and muſt tell you I am not yet ſatisfied with the title of your Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>

               <head>THE QUESTIONS Between the CONFORMIST AND Nonconformiſt, Truly ſtated, and briefly diſcuſſed.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not without the ordering of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that the day which the Imitators of the Heathens <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, did conſecrate to their St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> ſhould be the day on which the blood of ſo many thouſand Proteſtants was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in <hi>France,</hi> and the day alſo on which ſo many hundreds of Goſpel-Miniſters, to whom Chriſt had given both will and skill for his work, ſucceſs in his work, were turned out of his work in <hi>England.</hi> The crime both there and here which they found, was the ſame the Princes found againſt <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Law of his God. A day of gladneſs it was to many, but not to all upon the ſame ground. One Conformiſt, and a man of note, tells a Captain under his Majeſty, ſince his Return, that he was glad ſo many Miniſters refuſed to conform; the Captain would know his reaſon: he gives it thus: <hi>Had all Miniſters conformed, people would have thought there was nothing in Religion, only a thing to talk of in the Pulpit, and ſerve a State-deſign, for theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will turn any way the State turn: But by their giving up their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98093:9"/>and expoſing themſelves and families to outward evils, rather than they would conform to things impoſed not agreeable (as they apprehended) to the Goſpel they preached, they have convinced men there is reality in Religion, and given a check to Atheiſm.</hi> This was the ſubſtance; and to be ſure he was not more glad than I was, when the Captain told me his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>How zealous yet ſome have been to bring us over to Conformity, the many Books publiſhed for it, and againſt us, have declared. Some of which have come to my hand, but all were not written with the ſame Spirit. As they came to hand, ſo I peruſed them, to ſee if I could find any thing to convince me. And whereas there are five things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon us, 1. The Liturgy, with ſtinted forms of prayer. 2. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Ceremonies. 3. Subjection to <hi>ſuch</hi> Epiſcopacy. 4. Re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 5. Renouncing the Covenant. I applied my ſelf to the three firſt Queſtions chiefly. For if it can be proved that theſe are <hi>agreeable with,</hi> and <hi>conformable</hi> to the Laws of God, as the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Templer,</hi> would perſwade their Readers, then Re-ordination may be admitted, and the Covenant renounced.</p>
               <p>As to the two firſt Queſt. Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> was the firſt man I met with that argued for them; after him I met with the <hi>Friendly Debate;</hi> next, with the <hi>Serious and compaſſionate Enquiry, &amp;c.</hi> (Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> the Author as I hear, <hi>Nemine contradicente),</hi> but laſt of Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> a man of an excellent ſpirit, whom I ſhall honour, and one that hath ſaid more than all before. Before he came forth, I had drawn up my anſwer to all the former, and was loth to throw away all I had done, becauſe I ſaw there were ſome things in theſe Authors which Mr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> had not, elſe I would wholly have attended him; but where I ſaw they all agreed, there I conſidered them conjunct; where one had what the other had not, there ſeverally.</p>
               <p>As to the third Queſt. ſomething I found in a piece Entituled <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſm.</hi> As to the Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> by throwing down the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of any form of Church Government, he prepared the way for our ſubjection to ſuch <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> if his principle be ſound.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>ſerious and compaſſionate Enquiry,</hi> I found little in that piece as to our queſtions, unleſs a man were ſo ſimple to take fine words for ſtrong arguments, and Rhetorick for Logick. For his Diſcourſe about <hi>ſchiſm,</hi> I ſhall conſider it in its place. But the chief things I obſerved in him, were his odious compariſons between the Conformiſt and Nonconformiſt, begun at <hi>p.</hi> 21. and continued ſome <hi>pages</hi> His ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that worthy Father bleſſed <hi>Auſtin;</hi> the contempt he throws upon the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which I did never expect from the pen of a Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But I ſee this Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98093:9"/>famons Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not the ſame. I need not ſay any thing, there is an acute pen hath given him ſo full and ſolid an anſwer, that I ver expect to read his Reply.</p>
               <p>To what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Nonconformiſts blame the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles are not ſo punctual in defining the five points debated at the Synod of</hi> Dort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think I may ſay, I have been in the company of as many Nonconformiſts as that Author, but I have not heard them blame the Articles therefore. But this fault I have heard found, and do find, that we are commanded to affent to the 34, 35, <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. Articles with the ſame faith we do to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles of our Faith and Salvation therein contained.</p>
               <p>I thought among the Confeſſions of Faith, theſe 39 Articles were looked upon as the Confeſſion of the Faith of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but I find it otherwiſe now; for Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his defence of Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> p. 54. being pinched by the Jeſuit, (who in this point is not anſwered) tells us, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>makes no Articles of Faith, but ſuch as have the Teſtimony of the whole Chriſtian world in all Ages, acknowledged to be ſuch by</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf. And in other things ſhe requires ſubſcription to them, not as Articles of Faith, but inferiour truths, which ſhe expects a ſubmiſſion to in order to her peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>p</hi> 82, <hi>&amp;</hi> 104. <hi>He diſtinguiſheth between the internal aſſent of the mind, and the external act; the Church doth not require the firſt, but the latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To confirm his ſaying, he quotes Archbiſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to her 39 Articles, thus: <hi>Neither doth the Church of</hi> England <hi>define any of theſe queſtions as neceſſary to be believed, either</hi> neceſſitate medii, vel praecepti, <hi>which is much leſs; but only bindeth her Sons for peace ſake not to oppoſe them.</hi> And in another place more fully, <hi>We do not ſuffer any man to reject the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>at his pleaſure, neither do we look on them as eſſentials of ſaving Faith, or Legacies of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; but in a mean as pious opinions, fitted for the preſervation of unity; neither do we oblige any man to believe them, but only not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them.</hi> Thus the Archbiſhop. And this is not his opinion alone, but generally of the Grandees of <hi>this</hi> Church, as an intelligent and ſober Conformiſt tells me.</p>
               <p>When I read theſe lines firſt, I read them again, and again, to ſee if I were not miſtaken, they were ſo ſtrange unto me at the firſt reading; when I ſaw I was not miſtaken, I turned to the beginning to ſee who did Licenſe it, and was amazed when I ſaw the name. According to this, <hi>Cerinthus, Pelagius, Arius, Socinus, Turks, Jews,</hi> yea <hi>Vaninus,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98093:10"/>may all ſubſcribe the Articles, and be Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they can but keep their tongues from <hi>contradicting</hi> them, though they do not believe one of them. Though I am a Nonconformiſt, yet I am ſuch a friend to the Church of <hi>England</hi> as to her Doctrine, that I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor theſe lines, and charge that Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> with doing wrong to the Church. It ſeems when other Churches abroad read theſe 39 Articles as the Confeſſion of the Faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſuppoſe we do believe them to be true, they are groſly miſtaken, it may be we believe not <hi>one;</hi> the Church do not oblige her Sons to it, but only not to contradict them. They are deluded, the Church reproached, and God is mocked.</p>
               <p>Several things I could ſay to the diſproving of this ſenſe; but to what worthy Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> hath ſaid, I ſhould deſire him to name that Book of publick authority to warrant what he ſaith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kings Declaration prefixed for the confirmation of them, and with that I queſtion not but the Biſhops did agree
<note n="*" place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration expreſſed. With the advice of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Biſhops, &amp;c.</note>, makes no ſuch diſtinction of ſuperiour and inferiour Truths, but ſpeaking of all the 39 Articles jointly taken together, thus declareth: <hi>The Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>do contain the true Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>agreeable to Gods word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>requiring all our ſubjects to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform profeſſion thereof.</hi> Again, <hi>requires all Clergy men to ſubmit to every Article in the plain and full meaning thereof; and ſhall not put their own ſenſe and comment to be the meaning of the Article, but ſhall take it in the literal and Grammatical ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, doth not the fifth Canon ſay, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall hereafter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that any of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles are in any part ſuperſtitious or errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ſuch as he may not with a good conſcience ſubſcribe unto, let him be Excommunicated,</hi> ipſo facto.</p>
               <p>Lay theſe both together, and how can we receive his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, doth the Church not care though her Sons be ſuch groſs Hypocrites? Doth not Reaſon and Religion teach me firſt to try, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and to believe the thing to be lawful before I practiſe? <hi>Whatever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14 23.</p>
               <p>I know two Conformiſts, one is known to be a right Son, the other is ſuſpected; neither of theſe do wear the Surplice; the reaſon is the ſame for both, neither Pariſh had provided one; when they came to the Court, the right Son hath nothing ſaid to him, though he did not practiſe; the other was <hi>ſuſpended.</hi> Was it not the <hi>internal aſſent</hi> that the Court regarded? it was that ſaved the true Son.</p>
               <p>Are we not commanded unfeignedly to <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to all things in the Common-Prayer Book, in which are ſeveral Creeds? and you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98093:10"/>tell us, the Doctrine of your Thirty-nine Articles, contained.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Head: of old he was eſteemed a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who was tite to the 39 Articles, ſubſcribing to them in their Literal and Grammatical ſenſe, as the King required. Now he is reputed <hi>the</hi> true Son of the Church, who doth but ſubmit to theſe three articles that reſpect the Ceremonies, Rites, Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let him for Doctrine be an <hi>Arminian, Socinian, Papiſt,</hi> no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how corrupt.</p>
               <p>I would have leſt Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> or whoever it was, that was the Author of the <hi>ſerious and compaſſionate Inquiry,</hi> &amp;c. till I had come to his ſtating of the Queſtions, but that I find him, <hi>p.</hi> 67, 69. giving one cauſe, which he imputes to us, worthy the taking notice of; and the ſpeaking to it here, will ſave me a labour afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A great part of this Nation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having been leaſened with</hi> Jewiſh <hi>ſuperſtition, or</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Traditions, hath thereby been indiſpoſed to an uniform reception of the reformation of Religion held forth by this Church;</hi> and thus doth charge us with <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> quoting <hi>Cartwright, Ainſworth,</hi> and <hi>H. Broughton,</hi> who were great Students in the <hi>Rabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical writings,</hi> and they leavened us, <hi>p.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>This is very ſtrange, when as if he will pleaſe to read over Mr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> he ſhall ſee how much he uſeth theſe <hi>Rabinical</hi> writings, and <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> cuſtoms to confirm the Liturgy, and Forms of Prayer, and the Rites and Ceremonies of this Church. Yea, Chriſt himſelf is not ſpared, but he is made a Conformiſt to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtoms, different from the Law, to prove our conformity. Thus <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and out of him Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Falkner.</hi> That I was ſtudying how to give anſwer to this head of argument in theſe men; and this it ſeems is charged upon us.</p>
               <p>To clear our ſelves then from this, and to give anſwer to the other men, I grant,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> had many Rites, Traditions, and Cuſtoms of their own; ſome of which the Holy Page od record. But for their <hi>Oral</hi> Law, Traditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were not committed to <hi>writing</hi> till the reign of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and not perfected till the year 219 after Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Buxtorf. Synag. Jud. p.</hi> 52. ſome ſay more. Now how ſhall we be infallibly certain, that what Traditions they then wrote were exactly the ſame, which they were in Chriſt his time, above 200 years before? in ſuch a ſpace of time how eaſily may things vary?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are infallibly certain that our Lord was an enemy to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Traditions; how then theſe ſhould be brought in to prove the lawfulneſs of the things in queſtion, I know not.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98093:11"/>
               <p>How will you infallibly prove the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the pureſt time, did tye up it ſelf to Forms of Prayer in publick adminiſtration? which though it could be proved, will not ſerve the turn, as we ſhall ſee when the queſtion comes to be ſtated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe Chriſt uſed ſome actions at his Supper like to the <hi>Jews,</hi> muſt he needs borrow them from the <hi>Jews</hi> to be conformable to them? I hope he did not learn to <hi>bleſs</hi> and <hi>give thanks</hi> from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> ſome ſay, lived before <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> or about his time; <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath expreſſions very like that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the deſcription of <hi>Tophet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Analet. Sacr. p. 425.</note> Iſa. 30.33. as if the Heathen drew with the ſame pencil, ſaith <hi>Doughtie.</hi> But did <hi>Iſaiah</hi> borrow from <hi>Heſiod?</hi> the ſame Author inſtanceth in many things more, and did the Penmen borrow (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpirit that inſpired them) from the Heathen? Becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> hath an expreſſion ſomething like to <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſtinction of the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> man, muſt <hi>Paul</hi> needs borrow it out of <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Nerimber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> would have him?</p>
               <p>Thus ſome have affirmed that <hi>John</hi> took up his Baptiſm from the <hi>Jews</hi> baptizing of Proſelytes, when others have ſhown that the <hi>Jews</hi> took it from <hi>John,</hi> when Chriſt put the queſtion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.23, 25. <hi>The Baptiſm of John, whence was it, from heaven or men?</hi> Why did they not anſwer from the <hi>Elders Tradition;</hi> it ſeems it was the <hi>counſel of God,</hi> Luk. 7.30. whatever theſe men ſay: and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33. <hi>He that ſent me to Baptize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I ſhall deſire that leave to lay by all theſe Quotations out of <hi>Scaliger, Selden,</hi> and other Rabinical men, as ſignifying nothing to the Queſtions in hand. We muſt have Scripture, and Scripture rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in matters of God.</p>
               <p>Here Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi> proves us to be guilty of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> telling his Reader, <hi>p.</hi> 69 this is their grand Hypotheſis, <hi>That nothing is lawful in the ſervice of God, but what is expreſly preſcribed in Scripture.</hi> Such an Hypotheſis I never ſaw yet in any of our <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> Books. I will yield him more. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not only expreſs Scripture, but neceſſary <hi>conſequence</hi> from Scripture; but then it muſt be <hi>neceſſary conſequence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Where the Lord hath leſt us only a <hi>General Rule,</hi> and hath not tyed us op to <hi>Particulars;</hi> let but the Particulars carry in them the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>General Rule,</hi> as the <hi>ſpecies</hi> includes the eſſence of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and we will yield them too.</p>
               <p>Yet this Doctor can tell his Reader, that this of <hi>expreſs Scripture is the Characteriſtical Doctrine of that party; and that we graft our Chriſtianity upon the ſcock of Judaiſm.</hi> Were the <hi>Jews</hi> tyed up to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture</hi> in all they did about the Worſhip of God? I think the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98093:11"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> had as much liberty <hi>then,</hi> as we have under the Goſpel. I ſhall give but one inſtance, though I could more.</p>
               <p>The Paſſover was a ſolemn Ordinance of God; now in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. there is a command given to eat it with <hi>bitter</hi> herbs;

                     </gap>
                  </note> we ſupply the word <hi>herbs;</hi> but the word is only <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> or <hi>Res amarae.</hi> The <hi>Chaldae, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Samaritan</hi> keep the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word without any addition of <hi>herbs.</hi> Here is only a <hi>General Rule</hi> given, but what thoſe bitter things ſhould be, whether <hi>herbs, roots, &amp;c.</hi> there is no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Hence then, I might go into ſeveral houſes at that time, where they had prepared in one houſe ſuch bitter herbs as <hi>Sichory, Wild Lettice,</hi> (which they ſay they uſed); in another houſe <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Horehound;</hi> in another <hi>Centory, Germander;</hi> in another bitter Almonds and <hi>Gentian, &amp;c.</hi> ſo mention twenty more differences, yet if <hi>Bitterneſſes</hi> were obſerved, the rule was kept. Again, ſhall theſe <hi>bitterneſſes</hi> be boiled or raw, beaten into a ſawce like our Muſtard, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith the <hi>Churoſeth</hi> was? here is nothing determined; be ſure there be <hi>bitterneſſes,</hi> and the general Rule is kept.</p>
               <p>Again, here is no mention made of drink; but to have a Lamb and unleavened bread eaten, and bitter things, and not drink, it had been a dry Feaſt, fit to choak them.</p>
               <p>Again, the Lamb muſt be <hi>roaſt;</hi> but how, muſt it be without a Spit, (as we uſe ſometimes) or with a Spit? and if ſo, whether with a Spit made of Iron <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Wood, and that of a Pomegranate tree, as a Learned man ſuppoſeth, who can tell? there is nothing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or expreſſed, and I prefume that Learned Author was not there to turn the Spit.</p>
               <p>Again, it muſt be <hi>roaſt,</hi> but muſt the fire be made of <hi>wood</hi> or <hi>coal,</hi> or <hi>turff,</hi> or other combuſtible matter? not a word of any ſuch thing. Thus I might reckon up many more circumſtances; that I wonder at this Author, and another of his party anſwering for their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, telling us, <hi>This is the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, that under the Law all ceremonies and circumſtances, are exactly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, not ſo under the Goſpel.</hi> How true this is, the Reader may judg.</p>
               <p>Leaving then this Author a while, let us come to the ſtating of the Queſtions; and for the firſt about <hi>Forms of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> begins his Book, and ſtates the Queſtion thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Forms of Prayer are lawful;</hi> thus it was ſtated in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement-houſe when Dr. <hi>Fern</hi> was Vicechancellor, and moderated.</p>
               <p>I yield it, being my own practice to compoſe Forms for my Children, and for others who could not expreſs themſelves in fit words in their families before their ſervants: and what then, what is this to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98093:12"/>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church hath power in circumſtances:</hi> and who denies it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Government; <hi>ſome Epiſcopacy is lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition muſt not be <hi>univerſal,</hi> for then we ſhall ſetch in a Univerſal Biſhop, which as yet our opponents do not like. Make it <hi>particular,</hi> for my part I yield it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now give the true ſtate of the Queſtions, and then leave it to the judicious Reader to ſee, whether any one argument the Conformiſts uſe, conclude the Queſtions.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt</hi> about impoſed Forms of Prayer, the queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt.
<note place="margin">The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Forms Prayer ſtated.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether the Lord Jeſus hath given ſuch power to any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſons (Civil or Eccleſiaſtical) to compiſe and impoſe their Forms of Prayer upon his Miniſters in the Goſpel-church, whom he hath ſufficiently qualified for his work, unto which he hath called them; ſo that in their miniſtration and worſhipping of God by prayer, his Miniſters muſt be tyed up to thoſe very Forms and Syllables, and not vary from them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me open the Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That Chriſt is Lord of his Houſe, King of his Church, having the only power over it to inſtitute what he pleaſe, no Chriſtian will deny.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. True Miniſters of the Goſpel are <hi>his</hi> Miniſters; they have their talents and abilities from <hi>him,</hi> their call and authority from him; Their Laws and Doctrine what they muſt preach, and how they muſt order all things in the Church, from <hi>him.</hi> They have a promiſe of his Preſence, and unto <hi>him</hi> muſt they give an account of their work.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Theſe Miniſters being <hi>his,</hi> are <hi>ſufficiently qualified;</hi> in one ſenſe it is true, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. who <hi>is ſufficient?</hi> but yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged that thoſe whom he takes into the Miniſtry be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſufficient</hi> men. <hi>Praying and Preaching</hi> are the two great works of a Miniſter, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. to declare the will of God, to the people; and to open and preſent the wants of the people unto God is their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and whom Chriſt ſends of his errand, he fits them for both, or never ſends them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11. He prepareth gifts for <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Forms of Prayer will make a man <hi>ſufficient,</hi> I know not who ſhall be <hi>inſufficient</hi> if he can but read well.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Theſe are Chriſts Miniſters in the <hi>Goſpel church.</hi> I hope 'tis no ſtrange thing to put a difference between the Miniſters of the Old and New Teſtament, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Spirit is given by Chriſts Aſcenſion in a greater meaſure both as to gifts and grace, to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98093:12"/>the body of the Goſpel-Church, than to the old Church, hath been unqueſtioned Divinity by the Conformiſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. For <hi>ordinary</hi> perſons to impoſe, ſuch as cannot, dare not lay claim to an extraodinary Miſſion as the Prophets and Apoſtles had. Yet the Apoſtles never impoſed their Prayers on the Churches.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. For theſe to tye up Chriſts Miniſters to words and ſyllables in Prayer from which they muſt not vary. This is the practiſe indeed; but this is the queſtion, by what <hi>right</hi> this is done?</p>
               <p>What I have heard in anſwer to it, is, that the Church allows our own Prayers before and after Sermon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Church allow it, I cannot tell; the genuine Sons of the Church ſay <hi>no,</hi> and will uſe only the Canon-prayer. The Arch-Deacon in his Viſitation, did dehort the Miniſters from the uſe of their own prayers, with theſe words, <hi>Though I do not command, nor enjoin you, yet I adviſe you to it;</hi> it is more out of fear, it would cauſe ſuch an <hi>Odium</hi> among the people, ſhould they take them off from their own prayers wholly in places where there is any knowledg; in ignorant places they uſe none at all but the Common-Prayer, as I have certain intelligence of divers places. The Fathers of the Church in their Conterence with the other Miniſters at the Kings firſt coming in, thus expreſs themſelves:
<note place="margin">Account of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, &amp;c. p. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>VVe heartily deſire that according to this Propoſal great care may be taken to ſuppreſs thoſe private conceptions of pray ers before and after Sermons.</hi> As the Judges are the Interpreters of Statute-Laws, ſo ſurely the Biſhops of the Canons. Now it is clear, they <hi>would</hi> take away all but Book-prayer. The judgment of Biſhop <hi>VVren,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Cozens</hi> is well known.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. But if ſuperiors being but ordinary perſons, have power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Forms at <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Lords ſupper, &amp;c.</hi> all but before and after Sermon; is it becauſe their power of impoſing is limited by God? where I pray? certainly by what power they take away the uſe of our own prayers before and after Sacraments, they may before and after Sermons, and that we ſee they deſire it might be done, but that they fear the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Let us come to their reaſons for this: One they draw from the Scriptures, and that is worth twenty others, if they do not fail in the managing of it. Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> and the reſt that meddle with Liturgies, inſtance in the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> the Prieſts had from God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23. the many Prayers and Praiſes in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. I wiſh theſe Gentlemen would caſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument into Form, and ſee how it will conclude the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion ſpeaks of <hi>ordinary perſons;</hi> and here is God himſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98093:13"/>commanding <hi>Aaron,</hi> and giving him a form of words, to which <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt conform or ſin. For others, here were extraordinary perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the Holy Spirit; Theſe are part of the Canon into which our Faith is reſolved, part of Scripture; and ſo <hi>given by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. This argument reaches not the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fr. Deb. par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 354. tell us, that <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Ezra, Daniel,</hi> uſed the words of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then? I pray conclude the queſtion. Beſides, as if we denied Miniſters to make uſe of Scripture-expreſſions, into which as I ſaid our Faith is reſolved. We commend ſuch prayers. I have heard a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt pray, and that for a convenient ſpace of time, his prayer was compoſed almoſt all of Scripture-expreſſions, but ſo aptly, that I could but wonder at the gift, and yet I perceived he did not tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Form.</p>
               <p>But were thoſe under the Old Teſtament tyed up to words and ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles impoſed upon them by ordinary perſons, and might not, or did not uſe their own gifts? prove that, elſe you are beſide the queſtion. Beſides our queſtion ſpeaks of a <hi>Goſpel-church,</hi> which that was not.</p>
               <p>But <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 354, 392. the <hi>Fr. Deb</hi> tell us, <hi>Chriſt uſed the ſame words three times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I pray caſt this argument alſo into form, ſee how it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the queſtion. As if we thought or ever ſaid, that every time a Miniſter pray, he muſt have new expreſſions; or denied that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under a heavy load upon his ſpirit as our bleſſed Lord had then, might not unload his grief to God in the ſame expreſſions.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit <hi>Clare</hi> tell us,
<note place="margin">Arraign. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Jew, p. 105. Fr. Deb. p. 360.</note> that the cuſtom of praying ſo often upon <hi>Beads,</hi> is warranted from this example of Chriſt, uſing the ſame <hi>words</hi> three times; it proves both alike.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 360. <hi>A man may be a good Miniſter, and yet want the gift of extemporary conceptions in prayer. In the requiſites for a Biſhop,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>and</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>this is not required nor expreſſed, Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray, Sir, how came the word <hi>Extemporary</hi> to be foiſted into the queſtion? Have our <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſo ſtated it? every true Biſhop is able to pray ſo, as to preſent his own and the peoples wants and neceſſities before the Lord; whether he doth it by <hi>extemporary,</hi> or <hi>premeditated</hi> conceptions, is none of our queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No wonder though the Apoſtle did not expreſs it; a man I hope is firſt a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> before a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and if but a <hi>Christian,</hi> he can pray, much more if a Biſhop. <hi>Prayer</hi> was one part of the Apoſtles work, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. I queſtion much whether the <hi>Apostles</hi> had a ſtinted Liturgy then.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98093:13"/>
               <p n="3">3. Though we have but a little learning left, yet we underſtand a <hi>Synecdoche;</hi> the principal work, <hi>Teaching,</hi> is there expreſſed, but other work is comprehended.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of a Scholar I knew, of good natural parts, but of a profane ſpirit; upon a time he takes along with him another of his Companions to hear him, and gets into a Pulpit to try his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When he had done, he tells his Companion, <hi>I could make a ſhift to preach as well as any of them, but a Devil on't, I cannot Pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. When the Apoſtle wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I exhort that ſupplications, prayers, &amp;c. be made for all;</hi> he intended that prayer was a work incumbent on a Biſhop. But here I find Mr. <hi>Falkner, p.</hi> 109. with Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> making this Text to <hi>warrant the compoſing of Forms of Prayer.</hi> The words <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>may be taken in that ſenſe</hi> So he.</p>
               <p>But 1. <hi>Paul</hi> was as able to compoſe as <hi>Timothy,</hi> why did not he as an Apoſtle ſet him a pattern?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Suppoſe <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould compoſe, how will he prove that he <hi>impoſed</hi> them on the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who were able to pray without them? how this would agree with <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11. theſe gifts were for <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as well as <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlation will not admit this notion, for that reads the words thus, <hi>That thou offer ſupplication to God.</hi> It being <hi>Timothy</hi>'s, and Miniſters duties, not to <hi>compoſe</hi> prayers, and <hi>impoſe</hi> them on other Miniſters, but to <hi>pray, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. I pray what difference between theſe words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </p>
               <p>The next Scripture-argument I ſee they all make uſe of, is <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of John the Baptiſt, who they ſay gave to his Diſciples a form of prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98093:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſe <hi>John</hi> gave them a <hi>Form,</hi> make the argument into Form, and ſee how it concludes the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was neceſſary for <hi>John</hi> to teach them how to pray at ſuch a time, the Meſſiah being about to manifeſt himſelf; ſo that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might be ſuitable to the Diſpenſation they were under. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Were <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples Miniſters of Chriſt called by him to office?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Did <hi>John</hi> tye up his Diſciples to words and ſyllables, when his Diſciples were grown up in their underſtanding, and had gifts of their own? Though I gave my Children Forms of Prayers when they were young, I now expect they ſhould pray without thoſe Forms.</p>
               <p>This argument is yet too weak.</p>
               <p>The laſt argument I find out of Scripture, is <hi>the Prayer our Lord taught his Diſciples.</hi> All make uſe of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Let us hear the ſtrength: If Chriſt gave his Diſciples a Form (which is part of the Sacred Canon) and tyed them up to theſe words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>ordinary</hi> perſons may impoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a very ſtout argument! Chriſts and your authority it ſeems are equal. His is part of the <hi>Canon</hi> into which our <hi>Faith</hi> is reſolved, ſo it ſeems is <hi>yours.</hi> This Chriſt did when his Diſciples were but weak in gifts and grace, for Chriſt had not yet aſcended.</p>
               <p>But ſtill two things muſt be proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt gave them this for a Form; <hi>a perfect Form,</hi> as I hear it often expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That Chriſt tyed them up to theſe words and ſyllables, as you do to yours.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, That it was <hi>perfect</hi> for the end Chriſt gave it, I doubt not; that is, to give us a ſummary of Prayer, <hi>what</hi> we ſhould pray for. I ſhall quote but two or three that you will ſay were no Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts. <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Jeſuit, on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>Non his neceſſario verbis, ſed hac aut ſimili ſententiâ;</hi> quoting <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> for his judgment; but proves it beſt from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that did not uſe thoſe very words in their Prayers. <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i.e. <hi>in hunc ſenſum; non enim praecipit Chriſtus verba recitari, ſed materiam pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum hinc promere.</hi> And on <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. very fully, <hi>Doce nos compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um rerum orandarum, neque enim eo tempore ſyllabis adſtringebantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men then judg the <hi>matter,</hi> the <hi>Oranda,</hi> things to be prayed for, to be the intent of Chriſt, but not to tye us up to thoſe ſyllables, as you do to your Forms.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98093:14"/>
               <p>If that will not ſerve, then I will urge the very literal ſenſe, <hi>When you pray, ſay.</hi> 'Tis not, <hi>When you pray or ſay</hi> your <hi>Prayers,</hi> then ſay <hi>this;</hi> but <hi>when you pray, ſay.</hi> So that I ſhould uſe no other prayer when I do pray, but this.</p>
               <p>If that will not do, yet it binds that <hi>always when you pray,</hi> this you muſt ſay; but when? at the beginning, end, or middle of my own prayer? Here is nothing. And your Conformiſts do not ſay it at the end of their prayers, before and after Sermon too; in that I think you are to blame.</p>
               <p>That this Form of Prayer our Lord left us is <hi>perfect,</hi> as to the end he intended by it, I eaſily yield. But if by a <hi>perfect form,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch a <hi>form</hi> of Prayer, as contains in it all the parts that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to Prayer, and therefore called a <hi>perfect form,</hi> as the opinion and practiſe of many would make us believe, I cannot eaſily yield to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> is commonly thus deſcribed, and I think very fully and truly. <hi>It is an offering of our deſires to God for things agreeable to his will in the name of Chriſt, with confeſſion of our ſins, and thankeful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are four things expreſſed, as requiſite to make up a perfect Form of Prayer: They are <hi>partes Integrantes,</hi> or <hi>Conſtituentes</hi> of this <hi>Totum.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Confeſſion.</item>
                  <item>2. Petition.</item>
                  <item>3. Thankſgiving.</item>
                  <item>4. The offering up of all in the Name of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As for <hi>Petition,</hi> (which to ſpeak <hi>ſtrictly</hi> is prayer in that part we preſent our <hi>deſires),</hi> this is very fully expreſſed in our Lords Prayer, and in this reſpect it may well be called a <hi>perfect Form.</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we can rightly deſire, but it is <hi>reducible</hi> to one of theſe ſix Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and contained in them, as <hi>Concluſions</hi> are in their <hi>Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us come to ſome other Parts.</p>
               <p>To offer up our Prayers to God in the Name of Chriſt, is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of a Chriſtians prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24. God brought his people to pray towards the Temple; ſo did <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. and <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this part is neither expreſſed nor contained in this Form of Prayer. If any Heretick will deny that we are to pray in the Name of Chriſt, convince him out of this Form of Prayer if you can.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98093:15"/>
               <p>For <hi>confeſſion of ſin;</hi> I grant it is tacitely implied in that petition for pardon of ſin; we do <hi>confeſs by conſequence</hi> we are ſinners, and have ſinned, in begging pardon.</p>
               <p>But confeſſion of ſin, and petition for pardon of ſin, are two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things, yea differ exceedingly; a man may pray, as moſt men do, for pardon of ſin, from a principle of meer natural ſelf-love; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin is a thing man cares not for; even good <hi>David</hi> was not very forward to it at one time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 5. much of a gracious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may appear in confeſſion of ſin. Now one would think that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one part to make up prayer, it ſhould be as plainly expreſſed as other parts are, being a principle to which all Confeſſions different for Aggravations, Circumſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould belong and be reduced, as it is in <hi>Petition.</hi> And as it is in the Commandments, we reduce many ſins and duties to theſe Commandments, but the Command to which they are reduced, is plainly expreſſed, and not tacitely only implied in another.</p>
               <p>So that I conclude with <hi>Grotius</hi> as before: It is a thing often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, men that in their converſation live in open rebellion againſt God, while they are about Divine Worſhip, they carry themſelves ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanely, that one would think theſe perſons do not believe there is a God to worſhip; when they ſhould attend to the Word preached, they are talking, or jeering, or ſleeping; at the Miniſters prayer, ſit on their tails as if no ſuch ordinance in hand; but if the Miniſter come to the Lords-Prayer, then clap their Hats before their eyes, and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over the words; and now I hope they have worſhipped God well. But I leave it, let men uſe it, or not uſe it, at the end of their prayers, they ſhall not offend me.</p>
               <p>I have done with all the <hi>Scripture-arguments</hi> I meet with in all their Books;
<note place="margin">Par. 1. pa. 64.</note> the <hi>Fr. Debate</hi> I ſee in that place where he produceth the <hi>Form of the Lords-Prayer,</hi> tells his Reader, <hi>That the Nonconformiſts will not give the title of Saint to one of the Apoſtles, for no other reaſon that he can conceive, but their good Dames and Masters do not like it, they will not offend their tender ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, ſince you profeſs your ſelf to be ſuch a maſter of reaſon, I pray give a reaſon why we may not as well ſay Saint <hi>Abraham,</hi> St. <hi>Samuel,</hi> St. <hi>Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> as well as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> or St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> forſooth? do the holy Prophets deſerve ſo little in compariſon of theſe two laſt Saints?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. And I pray give a reaſon why we may not as well ſay <hi>Mathew, Mark, Luke, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> as well as <hi>Clemens Romanus, Polycarpus, Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Athanaſius, &amp;c?</hi> which Authors I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98093:15"/>ſee ſeldom put the Epithete <hi>Saint</hi> to them. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in one Epiſtle ſix times calls him <hi>Paul</hi> without Saint. Sometimes I have met with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but not with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo commonly; though I do not deny but they may uſe that Epithere too, and I not ſee it. But did theſe Fathers forbear this word <hi>Saint,</hi> ſo as not (at leaſt always) as you do to uſe it, becauſe they would not diſpleaſe their good Dames and Maſters? or was it becauſe the art of <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> by the Triple-Crown was not then known as it is now? with whom it ſeems, as in other things you are pleaſed to ſymbolize, ſo in this.</p>
               <p>The next Head are their <hi>Reaſons</hi> why theſe Forms muſt be impoſed. Now as to all their Humane reaſons in theſe caſes concerning God. I ſhall not much weigh them. For there is no man will ſet up his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Gods Worſhip without Reaſons; <hi>Jeroboam</hi> will not ſet up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> but he hath his Reaſons, 1 <hi>King</hi> 12.26, 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is a fool indeed that hath no reaſon to give for his act.</p>
               <p>I much applaud one ſentence of the Schools in this caſe, and it had been well if they had kept to it: <hi>Sacra ſcriptura, eſt lex Ecclaſiae, fidei menſura, Regula intellectus, Humanae ratiocinationis fraenum.</hi> I will yet take a view of their Reaſons that are of moment.</p>
               <p>One I find in the <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> Par. 1. pag. 93. <hi>It is ſo lawful to uſe a form of words in prayer, that it is in a ſort neceſſary; we can have no ſecurity that the ſervice of God will be performed well without one. The beſt of men though their hearts be full of good deſires, may from ſome cauſe or other, want ſuch words as are fit to expreſs their meaning; hence may uſe words rude, ſlovenly, obſcure, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> hath one like to it, only he doth not put the word <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to it. <hi>Neceſſity</hi> I grant is a ſtrong reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Rude ſlovenly words, are ſuch as I do not remember I have heard; once I heard an expreſſion that was not ſo becoming, and the perſon being told of it, reformed it, and never uſed it more; a better way to deal with perſons, than impoſe and tye up to ſyllables.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Will not this reflect upon Chriſt very much? Either,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. He did not foreknow the infirmities of his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Or though he did, yet he knew how to help them, or pardon them, and yet accept of their ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Or if he did foreknow them, and by a <hi>form of words impoſed,</hi> all theſe infirmities might be prevented, his Worſhip ſecured, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performed than now it can be <hi>without a form,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.6.</note> then <hi>Chriſt was not faithful in his Houſe as a Son;</hi> that would not provide for a thing <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> in his Houſe. The limitation <hi>after a ſort neceſſary,</hi> will not ſerve the turn, but it muſt reflect upon his honour.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98093:16"/>
               <p>Could not he have commanded his Apoſtles to compoſe one Liturgy that ſhould have ſerved all the Churches in the world? So it had been <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, and one Liturgy,</hi> and then that trite, but pitiful reaſon from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> had been anſwered; As if that <hi>unity</hi> Chriſt requires in his people and worſhip, could not be preſerved, without Uniformity in words and ſyllables.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. But there are ſome men, even of your Conformiſts a few, whoſe words when they have liberty to uſe their own gift, are ſo apt that the Devil himſelf cannot find a rude or ſlovenly expreſſion, why muſt Forms be impoſed upon ſuch men?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. We muſt have a Form before and after Sermon too; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may fall out which may cauſe rude and ſlovenly words in thoſe prayers, and ſo have nothing but Book-prayer.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. We muſt take away all Preaching too, and uſe only Homilies, for fear of rude, ſlovenly words, and unhandſome expreſſions in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; where be ſure they are too common with ſome. (How many Sermons in Conventicles Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi> heard, that he can charge them upon us, as he doth in his odious Compariſons, <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know not, I ſuppoſe he never heard one; may be I can tell him of an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of his Biſhops, and that in print too, that was not very handſome for a Sermon.)</p>
               <p>But if he denies this, becauſe we may write down our Sermons and read them, as commonly you do; truly that doth not always ſerve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But however I reply, ſo may you compoſe your own prayers, and write them down, and read them, as you do your other prayers impoſed, and ſo prevent ſlovenly words.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Suppoſe we meet (as often we do) with caſes, which when we come to ſpread them before God, your Book-prayer hath no words at all. What ſhall we do now? our own words we muſt not uſe, they may be rude and ſlovenly; and for your Forms, there is none ſuit the caſe in words at all? it ſeems we muſt let the caſe alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fr. Deb. p</hi> 96, 97. urgeth this argument, <hi>It is as lawful to uſe a Form of Prayer in proſe, as in verſe; but here you do not ſtick at it, when you can ſing</hi> David<hi>'s Pſalms tranſlated into</hi> Engliſh <hi>Meter, though the words be mean, uncouth, and the ſenſe often miſtaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Where lyes the ſtrength of your argument? if in the <hi>uncouth words,</hi> for this cauſe, and the ſenſe changed, I have not uſed the Pſalms by <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternbold</hi> many years. Others are uſed generally by the <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98093:16"/>
               <p n="2">2ly, Prayer or praiſe offered to God in <hi>verſe,</hi> require ſome art to make true Verſe, and fit Rime, ſuitable to <hi>Engliſh</hi> ears; every one who hath the gift of <hi>Prayer,</hi> hath not the gift of <hi>Poetry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The people being to join in ſinging, and lift up their voice on high, if they do not know before hand what to ſing, will make mad work; there cannot be <hi>joint ſinging</hi> without a Form, ſo that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But in prayer their hearts are only to join and give their <hi>Amen.</hi> If the Paſtor be the mouth of the Congregation, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice publick, belonging to a publick perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. But it ſeems they are <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> compoſed by a Prophet,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.1, 2, 3.</note> part of the <hi>Canon;</hi> and what was done here, was by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29 25, 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.15. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.14. So that ſtill, Sir, your conſequence is denied, the queſtion not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>But <hi>pag</hi> 94. <hi>All Churches in the world have had their publick Forms,
<note place="margin">Fr. Deb.</note> he tell us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray add, and thoſe <hi>impoſed by ordinary men,</hi> and all the Miniſters tyed up to them, elſe you miſs the queſtion.</p>
               <p>I pray, Sir, ſpeak low, the little word <hi>All</hi> makes ſuch a noiſe that it troubles. What, the Apoſtolical Churches too? Will you prove to us invincibly that the <hi>Liturgies</hi> which go under the name of <hi>Peters, James, Marks, Andrews</hi> Liturgies, are genuine, faithfully theirs, and not ſpurious? Learned <hi>Mornaus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. cap. 2.</note> hath ſpoken ſo much to theſe, and ſo convincingly; alſo

                  <hi>Rivet</hi> quoting <hi>Bellarmine</hi> againſt them, that I wonder any Proteſtant ſhould name them to patronize their Liturgies.</p>
               <p>If <hi>All</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what is the reaſon that Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> dare not venture above thirteen hundred, and Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> but twelve hundred years, and leave three hundred years of the beſt times of the Church next to Chriſt, in which they dare not affirm there were any Forms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? Of which a word hereafter.</p>
               <p>To conclude this: If foundneſs of Doctrine, purity of Worſhip, and a converſation in ſome meaſure becoming the Goſpel, be any true notes of a Church of Chriſt, then there <hi>have</hi> been, and I know <hi>are</hi> ſuch Churches where no Forms of Prayer are compoſed, much leſs impoſed upon the Miniſtry; that it was but a bold aſſertion of him to ſay <hi>All</hi> Churches had them.</p>
               <p>I find no more in Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> nor the <hi>Fr. Debat.</hi> I ſee Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> hath ſummed up five Reaſons, which have been uſed by others moſt of them.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98093:17"/>
               <p>His firſt, <hi>The ſecurity of the Worſhip of God.</hi> This we had before. His ſecond, <hi>That needful comprehenſive petitions for all common and ordinary, ſpiritual and outward wants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with fit Thanksgivings, may not be omitted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Surely, Sir, he is but a mean Miniſter that cannot do this without a Book; though I know there is a vaſt difference in gifts, yet there is no true Miniſter but is able in ſome good meaſure to do this; the different Congregations are to be conſidered; ſome mens gifts may ſerve for ſome places well, that will not for others.</p>
               <p>His third, <hi>That the affections and hearts of pions men may be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vont,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when they may conſider before-hand, what particular prayers they are to offer up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who are further off from theſe, and care leſs for them, than your moſt truly <hi>pious men,</hi> who walk moſt with God, ſuch as can pour out their ſouls before God in prayer, (I ſpeak of private men) in another manner than moſt of your Miniſters can do; how have I heard them complain of theſe as deading their ſpirits! That truly, Sir, your argument from <hi>pious and religious hearts,</hi> was quite beſide the buſineſs; they are your <hi>formal</hi> Chriſtians, who ſooth up themſelves in their outward performances, that are the moſt devout at theſe.</p>
               <p>But, 2ly. ſince I ſee you have twice quoted the <hi>Liber Ritualis</hi> in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches on your ſide, and againſt us, let me give the Reader an account of it out of <hi>Comenius,</hi> the ſame Author and Book which you quote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When a Miniſter is ordained, the Ritual-book is given to him,</hi> (ſo far you ſay true; but then he goeth on, which you conceal); <hi>this Ritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book the common people were not to ſee; when the Miniſter died, the Book was returned to the Elders again. Not that the Miniſters were bound up to thoſe words and ſyllables in the Book.</hi> (ſaith <hi>Comenius) but they were left free.</hi> (This is quite againſt you) He goeth on, <hi>By this means the hearers were made more attentive, and greater admirers of the grace of God. For to rehearſe only Forms, or things preſcribed what will there be to excite attention?</hi> Quite croſs to you. The reaſon why they ſuffer not the people to have theſe Books, is, that the people might not ſlight or deſpiſe them. <hi>Had the people the Books</hi> (as ours the Common-Prayer Book) <hi>they would more obſerve whether the Miniſter read right, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Comenius.</hi> Thus we ſee when we go from the Scriptures to Humane Reaſons, how Reaſons claſh againſt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

               <p>I could alſo quote <hi>Rivet,</hi> whom you quote on your ſide for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; he mentions your Surplices in <hi>England,</hi> which you retain <hi>ex reliquiis Papiſmi;</hi> and ſaith, if you do it in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or for <hi>ſome myſtical ſignification</hi> (which you do) then 'tis <hi>not to be born,</hi> ſaith he; In his pious and learned Homily <hi>de Orig. errores,</hi> grounded on the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. he ſaith, <hi>Mens departing from the ſimplicity of Chriſt, is the original of all error.</hi> Chriſts wiſdom is too low for men.

               </p>
               <p>I will not deny but you may quote many againſt us. But, 1. I am of that Faith concerning Churches which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is concerning <hi>General Councils,</hi> Act. 21. <hi>when General Councils are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together (for ſo much as they be an aſſembly of men, whereof all be not governed by the Spirit and Word of God) they may err, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have erred in things pertaining to God, &amp;c.</hi> even good men may err. We know but in part.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. We have Churches, if there be any true in the world, that are againſt theſe things; ſo that here is the Teſtimony of Churches againſt Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The Holy Scriptures are the Rule of all Churches to which they ought all to conform. Wherefore <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaid right, and as became a Chriſtian, in the Council of <hi>Nice, Let us take our reſolution of queſtions out of the Books that are Divinely inſpired.</hi> To be ſure they do not err.</p>

               <p n="2">2ly. Or if ſuch be compoſed for your <hi>Tyrenes,</hi> when they firſt come into the work, muſt they needs be continued when they are grown more able? the ableſt and oldeſt men in <hi>England</hi> muſt be tyed up to words and ſyllables, as if they were ſtill Novices.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Truly, Sir, you muſt not much boaſt of your Form in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; for the <hi>Parental-Covenant</hi> which is the only foundation of the adminiſtration of that Ordinance to Infants, <hi>the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his ſeed,</hi> this is not at all taken notice of in your Form. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other things which I ſhall not meddle with now, for I do not aim at your Liturgy more than any other in my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His laſt reaſon, <hi>To be an evidence to other Churches, and future times, after what way and manner we worſhip God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But, Sir, cannot that be done unleſs we leave them the words and ſyllables of our prayers, to which we were continually bound up? will not the Confeſſion of our Faith, and a Directory for Worſhip, (if the Aſſemblies Directory be not ſufficient, I pray let your party mend it) do this ſufficiently?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If this reaſon be forcible, was it not as ſtrong in the Apoſtolical Churches, and much more than now? Why did they not leave their Liturgies that all Churches after them might know <hi>their way and man ner of worſhipping God?</hi> all their words in prayer? So name you but one argument that was not of as much validity in the Apoſtles time as now. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, prevention of errors,</hi> of <hi>rude and ſlovenly words and expreſſions,</hi> and what elſe you pleaſe. Then do but bring us <hi>forth their Forms</hi> which they impoſed upon the Churches, and give us but infallible ground for our faith to believe, that theſe they were, and no alteration in the leaſt, then Sir, we ſhall liſten to your reaſons.</p>
               <p>From other men I have heard other arguments: One I heard from a Learned Phyſician, who had it from Biſhop <hi>Sparrow</hi> in a Sermon, and was much taken with the ſtrength of it. <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>their own prayers were better than the prayers of the Church, yet obedience is better than ſacrifice.</hi> Saul<hi>'s obedience had been more acceptable than the fat beaſts he ſpared for ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtrength of this argument let us ſee: Here is a King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give obedience to <hi>God immediately,</hi> and that abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any queſtion. Our caſe is, we are called to give obedience to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, but <hi>creatures;</hi> and that in ſuch things which concern God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98093:18"/>concerning which the Lord hath given us Commandments, to which all Superiours are as ſtrictly bound, as that King was to Gods command. Shall not we then firſt try whether <hi>Creatures commands</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the <hi>Creators commands?</hi> muſt not obedience to the <hi>Potter</hi> take place of obedience to the <hi>potſheard?</hi> if not, then <hi>Ephraim did well when he willingly obeyed the command of Jeroboam,</hi> Hoſ. 5.11. and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did well, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.8. in obeying the ſtatutes of their Kings. Whence in matters of God we are bound to try all things; though the Commands be not <hi>ſub codem gradu,</hi> yet if we ſuſpect them to be <hi>ſub codem genere,</hi> let us have leave to examine. But in ſhort, were it not for God, we could with as much eaſe give obedience to mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as you can. But this inſtance is againſt the Biſhop.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be a <hi>Betterneſs,</hi> and we deny to give it to God, then give us leave to take heed of the curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>Another common ſaying is this: <hi>All your conceived prayers are Forms to us:</hi> Ergo, <hi>theſe Forms are lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So is every mans Sermon; a man may make one Sermon, and in that comprehend all that is requiſite to a mans Salvation; but if a man ſhould only read that Sermon every Lords day, you would diſcern a difference between this Form, and the Sermons you hear daily, and think him worthy to be caſt out of his Miniſtry. All mens ſpeeches are but <hi>Forms</hi> in your ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, Therefore you do but <hi>Ludere Homonymia</hi> in the word <hi>Form.</hi> In every effect there muſt be a Form, though hard to find out. But Prayers compoſed of Confeſſions, Petitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch <hi>ſyllables, words, ſentences,</hi> to which men are tyed up in the Worſhip of God, this is the <hi>Form</hi> in queſtion. I grant by theſe, your Prayers differ from others, and ſo you make a formal difference. So we can allow there will be Forms in every mans Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. A man that improveth the gift which Chriſt hath given him, reſting upon the promiſe of the Spirit to help his Infirmities, he doth as he <hi>ought.</hi> Let his Prayers ſeem what they will to you, they are not Forms according to the queſtion, he is not tyed up to ſyllables, but hath his liberty to vary according to the ſubject-matter before him, Occuring Providences, and ſpirits aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Scripture grounds which have made me judg this unlawful, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 8, 11, 12. <hi>Chriſt when he aſcended, gave gifts unto men,</hi> v. 8. and theſe <hi>men</hi> amongſt others are <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> v. 11. the end of theſe gifts and officers, <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 12. True indeed theſe <hi>gifts</hi> differ very much in men. So the 7th. <hi>v.</hi> tells us, <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98093:19"/>to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> But though the meaſure differ, yet ſo much is given to every Paſtor and Teacher, let him but be ſaithful in the improvement of it, as ſhall ſerve the end Chriſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Having gifts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I am ſure among theſe gifts the gift of Prayer is one ſo requiſite in a Miniſter, and ſo common to all true Chriſtians, yea to Hypocrites. But this practiſe renders Chriſts act but various, and croſſes him in what he <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> in giving gifts; for though he doth give them, they muſt not uſe them, nor improve them; why then did he purchaſe them, and give them? it ſeems he gave gifts, to one or two in a Nation (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Prayers is not the work of a multitude), to compoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and theſe muſt be impoſed on all the Miniſters in a Nation, with a ſtamp of Authority; though Chriſt hath given gifts to all his Miniſters, and many of them as able, and more able than are the Compoſers and Impoſers; but their gift muſt lye dormant, they are tyed up to words. It was a ſilly anſwer <hi>he</hi> gave, <hi>They may uſe their gifts at home.</hi> The Text confutes him.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That Command, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. that <hi>Timothy</hi> look to it, that thoſe whom he admits into the Miniſtry, be faithful men, <hi>and able to teach others;</hi> is any man ſo abſurd to think that an ability to pray for others is not included; remembring 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. and a gift ſo common to all Chriſtians? But this croſſeth the Command; for though they be never ſo able to pray, they ſhall not uſe their gift or ability, but be tyed up to other mens words and ſyllables. Why not before Sermons, as before Sacraments? give us a Text. But your own party think even <hi>thoſe</hi> prayers are taken away, or wiſh they were, even before Sermon.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. As Chriſt purchaſeth and giveth gifts, and requires gifts, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in thoſe whom he calls to his work, ſo no doubt but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account of the uſe and improvement of thoſe gifts. That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial gifts are comprehended in the Talents given forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. I think no underſtanding Divine will deny; in the 19 <hi>v.</hi> he <hi>will reckon with them.</hi> What account then ſhall we give for this, when one Talent we neglected, contenting our ſelves meerly with other mens words?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. It renders the promiſe of the aſſiſtance of the Spirit in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. but vain in great part. The Spirit in prayer helpeth our Infirmities, not only in the <hi>manner</hi> of our prayer, but even in the <hi>matter</hi> of our prayer; the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> (falſly ſo called, for neither Author nor Book anſwer the title) <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 88. tells us, <hi>The Spirit of God doth not now ſuggeſt to any of us when we pray the very matter and words which we utter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That the Spirit ſuggeſteth <hi>All</hi> the words and matter, I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily deny; but that the Spirit doth help his people in the very matter of their prayers, the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I muſt own it, or give the lye to the Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let me appeal to the experience of praying Chriſtians, Miniſters and others; when we have been called forth in our Miniſterial work, or at other times to <hi>pray;</hi> that was the work lay before us: when our hearts have been oppreſſed with ſome temptation, our ſpirits quite down, dead, and flat; the thoughts of our duty a terrour to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we found no ability to it; we could not tell what-to ſay unto the Lord, we wanted words, we wanted hearts, we wanted every thing, but to our work we <hi>muſt</hi> go, we could not avoid it. Well, when we have been entred into our work, have we not found a ſupply afforded, our tongues untyed, our hearts enlarged; words and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have come flowing in; ſuch ſentences, words and matter as were never in our minds before, yet very apt and pertinent; melting and warming, that the beſt prayers ever we made have been at ſuch times, when we have gone moſt preſſed with the ſenſe of our own inability? though it be not always ſo (the Spirit is a free agent), yet at theſe times, whence could it come but from this good Spirit? Shall he loſe his glory?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I thought that praying men uſe before-hand to pray for that good Spirit, for a preſence of <hi>Grace,</hi> (as to the ſpiritual manner of our work) and a preſence of <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> as to the matter of our work, being conſcious to our ſelves of the truth of the ſayings of that great Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and 2.16. how the Spirit inſpired the Prophets, we enquire not; but that he helpeth our Infirmities in our Duties, ſhew me the ſace of that Miniſter that feareth the Lord, who will deny it, and doth not feel the want of him.</p>
               <p>Having theſe Scripture-grounds, I go on to Arguments deduced alſo from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That practiſe which nouriſheth Miniſters in their <hi>lazineſs</hi> and <hi>ſluggiſhneſs,</hi> is certainly an unlawful practiſe.</p>
               <p>But this practiſe of Compoſing and Impoſing theſe Forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the queſtion, do ſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Miniſters duty is, <hi>to ſtir up the gifts of God which are in them,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. but that duty now as to the gift of prayer is layed by.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fr. Debat.</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Part 1. pag. 124.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſome of the Nonconformiſts are for Liturgy, but they think it not convenient for men of their parts and gifts:</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98093:20"/>
               <p>Truly, Sir, when our hearts are in any trim becoming the duty of prayer, we find it a very great hindrance to be tyed up to the Forms of other men; we cannot open our hearts, nor ſpread before the Lord our deſires in other mens conceptions; we cannot work with their tools. But when <hi>lazineſs, deſpondency,</hi> and <hi>unbelief</hi> prevail, it is as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> as may be for men of our ſinful tempers. I could tell you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the experience of my own carnal heart as to this point; but I find you are a perſon that jeer at the experiences of Chriſtians, and therefore let it alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are to pray for <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.1. I hope not only for <hi>extraordinary gifts: Every good and perfect gift,</hi> Jam. 1.17. tells us whence it comes. Then for a gift of Preaching, and a gift of Prayer. But why ſhould we pray for it, if when the Lord hath given it, we muſt not uſe it, but be tyed up to other mens Forms?</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you may impoſe Forms of Prayer, then you may impoſe Forms of Preaching; ſo leave us nothing but Forms of Prayer and Homilies to read; as indeed they came in both together. We have Forms of <hi>Preaching</hi> in the Scripture, as you have of Prayer; by what authority you take away one, you may take away the other. Your Humane reaſons that I have met with as yet, will as ſtrongly argue for Forms of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this argument was urged in the Commencement-houſe, the <hi>Reſpondent</hi> yielded it. But Dr. <hi>Fern</hi> being then Moderator, thought this was too groſs, and ſo denied the conſequence, <hi>Becauſe in Prayer we ſpake to God, but in preaching to men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctors anſwer was invalid; for in prayer we repreſent, and are the mouth of a people of Infirmities; we are but perſons of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Here Infirmities are but like us, the Lord expects no other from us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helps our infirmities</hi> in prayer. But in <hi>Preaching</hi> we ſpeak from God, we come in his Authority, and require Faith and Obedience to what we preach, therefore here we had need have a care what we ſpeak; for now we come with, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Diverſities</hi> of Gifts and Operations, are the Spirits work and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.6. Diverſities of <hi>Kinds,</hi> and of <hi>Degrees</hi> in thoſe kinds; this <hi>diverſity</hi> is ſeen in the gift of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as well as in other gifts. As to have in one Lords-day many thouſands of Miniſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſins, petitioning for mercies, pardon, purging, healing; praying alſo for Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they all aim at the ſame thing in their Prayers; but the words, ſentences, whereby they expreſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their minds, and deſires of their hearts, how various are they? the ſame Spirit that gave this diverſity of gifts, aſſiſts them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98093:20"/>in the exerciſe of them. And it is his glory which is taken away, while theſe thouſands of Miniſters are tyed up to the ſame ſyllables in their Book.</p>
               <p>This <hi>multi-form unity</hi> (if I may ſo call it, for here are various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, different ſentences, yet all tend to <hi>one</hi> and the ſame thing) hath better ground for it in Scripture than <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in ſyllables.</p>
               <p n="8">8. What want of <hi>wiſdom, care,</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> yea want of all, <hi>this</hi> (with your Ceremonies) charges upon the Apoſtles, all men may ſee; you pretend much <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>care</hi> of Gods worſhip in theſe things; were the Apoſtles ſo defective in wiſdom and care, that they could not foreſee the uſefulneſs of theſe things in the Church, and appoint them as well as you. And that, when there were the ſame reaſons that you urge for them <hi>now,</hi> in their time? We are built upon the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prophets and Apoſtles;</hi> and take them to be as wiſe as any of their followers.</p>
               <p>To conclude, how honourable is this for the Miniſtry? I will take a boy of eight years old, and teach him to read with a grave tone, a thing eaſily done, and this boy ſhall be able to perform all your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Offices, excepting <hi>Preaching,</hi> which he may eaſily procure once a month, and he at other times read but Homilies. As did that Prieſt who was my Predeceſſor, (only one Miniſter for a ſhort time between us) that for fifty years could do no other but read his Book, (except one Sermon, and that a ſtrange one.) Yet he a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> takes the maintenance, and lets the people provide a Preacher at their charge, he contributing ſomething, as that I ſuppoſe the Law would force him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> I ſee labours much in giving us an account of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Church, whatever was their practiſe, it will not reach the queſtion. But however, how will Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> give us <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the pureſt time of their Church-ſtate, did compoſe Prayers, and impoſed them upon the Prieſts and Levites, who were able to officiate without them? If he prove not this, (which he is never able to do) all that he hath writ about them, ſignifies nothing to the proof of the queſtion, and all that labour is but loſt.</p>
               <p>For the Chriſtian Church:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Can Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> give us an account infallibly of the practiſes of <hi>all</hi> the Churches after Chriſt for the firſt four Centuries? are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible records of them <hi>all</hi> come to our hands? I thought we fell ſhort abundantly of the records of <hi>all</hi> the Churches, there might be many for ought he knows that uſed no Forms.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98093:21"/>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is poſſible that he may find ſeveral Paſtors, or Biſhops that did compoſe their own Forms. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Can he prove they uſed only thoſe Forms, and did vary at no time? as was the practiſe of ſeveral of our old Divines, that had their Forms of Prayer before Sermon, (but of their own compoſing) and varied after Sermon according to the ſubject matter they had been Preaching upon. So did improve that gift they had received from Chriſt before and after Sermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He muſt prove they <hi>Impoſed</hi> theſe Forms of theirs upon other Miniſters <hi>able</hi> to officiate without them, and tyed them up to theſe ſyllables, elſe he miſſes the queſtion, and his labour is but loſt there too. Neither of theſe hath Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> proved.</p>
               <p>The 23 <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which ſome write was <hi>Anno</hi> 395, others 397, others 399, at which were 44 Biſhops, and good <hi>Auſtin</hi> amongſt them, thus ordered:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man ſhall uſe thoſe Forms of Prayer which he hath compoſed for himſelf, till he hath communicated them to more able Brethren.</hi> A Canon of a Council carries very much conviction with it! what was the practiſe there abouts, more than any thing Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? By this it appears that the more able Brethren did not <hi>firſt</hi> Compoſe the Prayers of thoſe who were leſs able. 2ly. Much leſs did they <hi>Impoſe</hi> them on thoſe who were <hi>able,</hi> and it may be more able than themſelves. Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> wrote more warily than Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> who dares not venture beyond twelve hundred years. This Canon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s meaning to be againſt Forms, better then Mr. <hi>Falkner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How long after this, the queſtion aroſe about <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Gregories</hi> Liturgies, and into what a corrupt ſtate the Church was fallen, when Impoſition began, Mr <hi>Falkner</hi> knows well.</p>
               <p>For that inſtance which Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> brings <hi>p.</hi> 107. to prove Forms to be in uſe from <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s compoſing of Forms of Prayer for his Soldiers; Whence he thus argues:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not probable that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the Emperour would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Godly Prayers for the uſe of his Soldiers, if ſuch Forms had not then been uſed in the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſee the Logick of this, and how it proves the Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> compoſed Godly prayers for his Soldiers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some one Biſhop or Biſhops, or Miniſters compoſed prayers for <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters.</hi> How does this follow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did well; and it may argue ſome did uſe Forms, and who denies it? But doth it follow that <hi>Miniſters</hi> did tye up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Forms? I hope Miniſters and Soldiers in a proper ſenſe differ.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did thus: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we may <hi>impoſe</hi> our Forms upon able Miniſters. How does this follow? nor would <hi>Conſtantine</hi> impoſe his Forms upon his Soldiers, able to pray without them: Can Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> prove it?</p>
               <p>Once more. Had there then been Common-prayers compoſed to which the Church did tye up her ſelf, would they not have compoſed one or two prayers for times of <hi>War?</hi> they did not deſerve the name of Common-prayers, if that was omitted; and if they had done it, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> we all know bore ſuch reſpect and honour to the Church, that he would have uſed thoſe prayers before his own, not lay by them, and compole others. As our King now commandeth the Liturgy of this Church to be uſed in his Armies at Land and Sea; there being pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that to me this inſtance of Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> is rather againſt him.</p>

                  </gap>, before a multitude of people; how <hi>lawful,</hi> yea how <hi>uſeful</hi> this may be, I do not deny; but for theſe Miniſters to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe Forms, and not labour to improve and increaſe their Talent, I think it is ſin againſt him, who hath <hi>given gifts,</hi> who <hi>requires gifts</hi> of all thoſe whom he ſends, and to whom they muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they improved and <hi>ſtirred up</hi> the gift he beſtowed upon them; never did Chriſt ſend that man into his work, upon whom he did not beſtow a gift of Prayer.</p>
               <p>How far the Congregational Divines have allowed of Forms of Prayer for ſome Miniſters, may be ſeen in that acute and learned Divine Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> to which Book Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tho.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si nullus ſit error hominis in hac circumſtantiarum determinatione conſtituenda, constitutio illa, habenda est quaſi ſimpliciter divina.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may ſee the modeſty of Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> that can tell his Reader ſo confidently, that this is our <hi>grand Hypotheſis,</hi> and the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical Doctrine</hi> of the Nonconformiſt party, <hi>That nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the ſervice of God but what is expreſly preſcribed in Scripture.</hi> The contrary to which he might have read in this Author, and in others, I queſtion not.</p>
               <p>But whether Ceremonies be but <hi>ſuch</hi> circumſtances, or only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is the queſtion. Let me ſtate the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion concerning Ceremonies ſtated.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whether</hi> Man <hi>may inſtitute Doctrinal-ceremonies, (or means for a ſpiritual end) impoſe them upon the Church, annex them to Gods own worſhip, yea ſo, that without the uſe of theſe, God muſt have no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip performed to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is the true ſtate of the Queſtion, obſerve the Preface to the Ceremonies in the Common-Prayer Book, and the practiſes of men.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98093:22"/>
               <p>They tell us in the Preface, <hi>The Ceremonies they have retained, are not dark and dumb ceremonies, but are ſo ſet forth, that every man may underſtand what they mean, and to what they ſerve, and ſuch as be apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignification, whereby he might be edified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may obſerve: 1. <hi>Man owes Duty to God;</hi> this is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 2ly. Becauſe the wiſe God hath not ordained means enough to put us in mind of this our duty to him by his Command, Threats, Promiſes, and his Ceremonies in both the Sacraments, <hi>men</hi> will inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Ceremonies to ſignifie and repreſent to us this our duty to him; this is plain; for 'tis expreſſed to be the <hi>end</hi> of theſe Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Theſe Ceremonies are ſo clear, point out and ſpeak ſo plainly <hi>(not dark nor dumb)</hi> our duty, that any man may underſtand what duty or grace they ſignifie.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Whereas our minds are dull to our duty, theſe Ceremonies help to ſtir up our dull minds <hi>to our Duty;</hi> and ſo ſtirring up, they help to <hi>edifie</hi> us.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are clear in the words of the Preface, no denying them; and in this they ſpeak more, and commend more their Ceremonies, than ever the great God did ſpeak of his.</p>
               <p>When I have urged the Conformiſts with theſe words, they would fly off from them; what care they for the <hi>Preface!</hi> But in ſo doing, do they ſhew themſelves <hi>rational men?</hi> does any wiſe man read a Law or Statute of men, and not look into the ſcope of the Law, the Preface to the Statute, ſo underſtand the mind and aim of the Legiſlators? Do they ſhow themſelves ſuch Chriſtians as they ought to be, by ſhutting the window for fear light ſhould ſhine in to hinder them from what they are reſolved to do? Let the Conformiſts conſider it.</p>
               <p>To proceed: 2. <hi>That theſe Ceremonies are impoſed upon the Church, and annexed to Gods own worſhip,</hi> is ſo viſible, that there needs no more words about it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they are ſo annexed, as without theſe God muſt have no publick worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Witneſs, firſt, <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-day, upon which day ſo many hundred Miniſters were turned out from their publick worſhipping of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſubſcribe to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Witneſs the Pariſh where I was Miniſter (and divers others) where for ſeveral weeks, yea months, the Church-doors were ſhut up, God had no publick worſhip, becauſe I would not conform to theſe Inventions.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Witneſs a Pariſh in <hi>Suffolk</hi> before the unhappy Wars began, while Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> there Domineered, becauſe there was no Surplice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98093:23"/>in the Church, the Church-doors were ſhut up two Lords-days, no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip performed to God until they got a Surplice to annex to his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>So that the ſtating of the Queſtion cannot be denied. Now let the Reader obſerve that worthy Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> and tell me which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his from Scripture concludes the queſtion.</p>
               <p>If it were no more but the firſt part, I thought it had been only in his power to inſtitute <hi>means to a ſpiritual end, and impoſe them on his Church,</hi> who is able to make a connexion between the <hi>means and the end.</hi> But it ſeems mens Ceremonies are ſo <hi>clear, bright,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak ſo plain</hi> (being not dark nor dumb, as they ſay) that they can teach men, and help them on to their duty, and ſpiritual ends, without the Spirit of God; or elſe the Spirit of God muſt truckle and come down, and make uſe of <hi>their means,</hi> becauſe they have appointed them, which I am ſure he hates.</p>
               <p>Do Kings ſtand upon their Prerogatives? ſhall any man dare to ſet his own Image upon Copper to have it paſs for a farthing in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? and yet ſhall <hi>men</hi> be ſo bold to ſet their ſtamp or inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a ceremony, as a means to a ſpiritual end, impoſe this upon the Church? What is this but to incroach upon Gods Prerogative? will he not require it?</p>
               <p>But ſo <hi>to annex them to Divine worſhip, that God ſhall have no worſhip without them;</hi> I wonder how ſuch thoughts could enter into the hearts of ſuch men as did own the true God, and believed him to be a jealous God, and the Holy Scriptures the Law of that God.</p>
               <p>Let me proceed to the further clearing of the Queſtion!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Ceremonies are <hi>humane Inſtitutions,</hi> depending only upon the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> of <hi>man.</hi> So that all <hi>natural</hi> Ceremonies, ſuch as are found among thoſe that have nothing but the light of Nature to inſtruct them, as <hi>lifting up the eyes, or hands: Bowing of the knees in prayer, &amp;c.</hi> found among Heathen: Theſe are excluded this queſtion.</p>
               <p>For theſe Ceremonies in the queſtion have nothing but ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mens <hi>wills</hi> for their ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Theſe Ceremonies have an <hi>Ordained ſignification;</hi> though the things in themſelves may have ſome aptneſs to ſignifie ſomething, yet they do not <hi>actually</hi> ſignifie, without the Ordination and Inſtitution of <hi>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in Baptiſm, and the Lords-Supper, though there was ſome apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Elements to ſignifie, yet they did not actually ſignifie till the Ordination and Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Such was the <hi>waſhing of the hands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> and <hi>putting off the Cloak</hi> before Prayer in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, which he charges with <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98093:23"/>
               <p>Such was the <hi>girding of their garments about their loins</hi> by the Prieſts in <hi>France</hi> in Divine Worſhip:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carang.</hi> p. 150.</note> Concerning which Pope <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi> the firſt, wrote an Epiſtle to the Biſhops in <hi>France,</hi> charging the Prieſts with <hi>ſuperstition;</hi> telling them they might as <hi>well hold a burning light, and a staff in their hands, theſe having their mysteries and ſignification as clear as the other.</hi> For as in the girding of the <hi>loins,</hi> chaſtity; ſo in the ſtaff your <hi>Pastoral Government;</hi> In the <hi>Light-candles,</hi> the <hi>light of good works ſhining before men</hi> are held forth; yet <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi> reproves them, and charges <hi>ſuperstition</hi> upon them: I am ſure then theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame.</p>
               <p>Things that ſignifie by <hi>civil custom,</hi> as the <hi>vail</hi> did the Womans ſubjection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. in thoſe times, have no place in this queſtion; the vail was in uſe many years, even among Heathens, before Chriſt was incarnate.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Theſe Ceremonies are ordained to ſignifie ſome <hi>ſpiritual duty</hi> we owe unto God.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. They are means, helps, to our ſpiritual <hi>edification;</hi> being very apt <hi>to ſtir up our minds to our duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Laſtly, they are appropriated to Divine Worſhip: yea ſo, that God ſhall have no worſhip if theſe be not admitted.</p>
               <p>Out of this we may make a deſcription of a Ceremony of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an outward ſign ordained by men in the time of Divine worſhip, to ſignifie ſome ſpecial grace or duty we owe to God; unto the performance of which, and our edification in ſo doing, this outward ſign is a mean; by its ſpecial ſignification and aptneſs to ſtir up our dull minds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed, I obſerve Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> brings many quotations out of antiqutiy, to ſtrengthen his diſcourſe about Ceremonies, and with theſe many are taken; but for my part I weigh them not at all, they ſignifie nothing to me. For the Spirit foretold, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.1. there ſhould be <hi>a great Whore, &amp;c.</hi> That the <hi>Whore</hi> there mentioned, is the Pontifician or Papal power now at <hi>Rome;</hi> or thus, <hi>Rome</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftian, not <hi>Rome</hi> Ethnick, I am ready to prove it, if Mr.
<note place="margin">The Whore got not into her Chair <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> but gradually, as the Churches grew more corrupt.</note> 
                  <hi>Falkner</hi> deny it. That <hi>Whore</hi> then <hi>muſt</hi> be, elſe the Prophecy muſt be falſe, which cannot be. But had all the Churches of Chriſt, and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was once a chaſte Spouſe, kept cloſe to the Rule of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>VVorſhip, Government,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it had been impoſſible for that <hi>VVhore</hi> ever to ſit there.</p>
               <p>Hence the wiſe God leaves Miniſters to their own wiſdom, and they thought they acted very wiſely, when they added <hi>this and that</hi> in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God; and formed their <hi>Church-Government</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>civil;</hi> and thus acting freely and wiſely as they thought,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98093:24"/>they brought about by degrees the Decree of God, the <hi>VVhore</hi> is ſet in her Chair as freely as if God had no Decree about her, nor reveal'd any Propheſie concerning her. So that all Mr. <hi>Falkners</hi> and others quotations, do but ſerve to ſhew us how the Churches acted to bring that <hi>Whore</hi> to her Chair, and ſo ſulfil the Propheſie; ſuitable to what Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> ſaid of Traditions. See the Title page.</p>
               <p>But though Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> give us <hi>theſe</hi> Quotations, is he or any man now able to give us a perfect account of the practiſe of <hi>All</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in thoſe times? ſome, it may be <hi>many,</hi> were far enough from theſe practiſes.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-day our Church-doors being ſhut up for a long time, I went to hear the Prieſt in the next Pariſh. He, I found, was teaching thoſe few that he had preſent (before there uſed to be a great Congregation) and grounding them in <hi>conformity;</hi> and informed them, that as God was pleaſed to inſtitute ſignificant Ceremonies in his Church, ſo the <hi>Church</hi> thought it meet to appoint <hi>her</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>When I heard this, that Text <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. came into my mind, where God ſpeaking of Chriſt, calls that <hi>man</hi> his <hi>Fellow.</hi> Indeed for him who is <hi>God-man,</hi> to be called Gods <hi>Fellow,</hi> we can ſee a reaſon; but how <hi>dirty ſinful men</hi> come to be his Fellows in taking upon them to inſtitute their Ceremonies in his Church, becauſe he had done ſo, I could not underſtand the reaſon of this.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> on <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. ſpeaks notably to this point; it is too long to tranſcribe all: The ſum is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you be free from the Rites that God did preſcribe, then are you free from the Traditions of men: It is a moſt wicked thing they ſhould impoſe this yoke upon you, and you are moſt fooliſh to ſubmit your necks to it. For God would not have aboliſhed the Ceremonial Law inſtituted by himſelf, that a new one may be invented by men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he goeth on more fully than I tranſcribe; though ſtill he would have Ceremonies for <hi>Decency and Order.</hi> But this is not the ſtate of the Queſtion, for the <hi>Preface</hi> tells us other things, wherefore theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are invented and impoſed. Yet that of <hi>Decency</hi> will not ſerve the turn: of which more preſently.</p>
               <p>But to return to that Prieſt who was thus inſtructing his people; the truth of what he ſaid, and what is now in practiſe, you may ſee in this Parallel.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98093:24"/>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>God</hi> takes things indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in their own nature, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains them to ſignifie ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace, or duty of man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
               <p>This cannot be denied of ſeve ral Ceremonies under the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. <hi>God</hi> appropriates theſe to his own Worſhip; the Prieſts muſt put off their garments when the Worſhip is ended.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>Gods</hi> Ceremonies, though they had ſome aptneſs to ſignifie, yet did not <hi>actually</hi> ſignifie, but by his Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>Gods</hi> Ceremonies, though in their own nature <hi>Indifferent,</hi> yet being commanded by <hi>God,</hi> are now <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. <hi>Gods</hi> Ceremonies were ſo inſtituted, that no Prieſt muſt dare to miniſter without them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.43.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. God puniſheth the Prieſts, and that ſeverely, if they obſerve not his Ceremonies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.43.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Man</hi> takes things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in their own nature, and ordains them to ſignifie ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual grace, or duty of man which he ows to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, <hi>Man</hi> appropriates his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Doctrinal Ceremonies, to the Worſhip of God, and there only uſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>Man</hi>'s Ceremonies, though they had ſome apmeſs to ſignifie, did not actually ſignifie, but by his Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>Mans</hi> Ceremonies, though in their own nature indifferent, yet being commanded by humane Authority, are now neceſſary. This is their language.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. <hi>Man</hi>'s Ceremonies are ſo inſtituted, that no Miniſter ſhall perform the Worſhip of God without them. God ſhall have no Worſhip without mans Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. <hi>Man</hi> puniſheth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel ſeverely for not obſerving his Ceremonies; Caſting them out of the Lords work; ſpoiling of their goods; Impriſonments, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Man</hi> runs even with God; but if Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> gives us the true notation of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> that which is <hi>ſupra-ſtatutum;</hi> if here be not ſuperſtition and very great boldneſs with God, I am much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> once or twice tells us, though he allows ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, yet by no means will <hi>allow too many, for then they would be burdenſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, if your Ceremonies have ſuch a vertue in them to ſtir up our dull minds to our duty towards God, where there is <hi>one,</hi> I pray
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98093:25"/>give us <hi>ten,</hi> our hearts are dull enough, and we want helps, if theſe indeed be helps.</p>
               <p>He tells us <hi>p</hi> 419. <hi>That all Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions muſt be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certainly lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>lawful</hi> I hope you mean agreeable to the <hi>Law of God;</hi> make but this good, and they ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> be obeyed. But this is the thing we much deſire, which Law of God do theſe agree with? I ſee and hear enough of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> but that this Text will warrant Ceremonies thus inſtituted by men in the Worſhip of God, I muſt ſee and hear more than ever I ſaw or heard to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> I ſee, make much uſe of this Text for all their Popiſh Trinkets; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, that <hi>Holy garments, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wax-candles,</hi> and their other Ceremonies, may be as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this Text, as <hi>bowing the knee in Prayer.</hi> But the Jeſuit wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Candle here I am ſure.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered how men of Learning, that had read over the 1 1th and the 14th <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Epiſtle, where we may plainly ſee what the Apoſtle points at, by his reproving the <hi>undecency</hi> and diſorder in their Congregation, ſhould make this Text a ground to ſet up humane Ceremonies of Doctrinal or Moral ſignification, in the Houſe and Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add but a ſew words:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> are no ſpiritual graces; for though the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and majeſty of the Worſhip of God, is in ſome meaſure violated without them; yet they are in themſelves but external circumſtances, common to Civil actions, Civil Courts and Societies, where unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and diſorder are blamed, and muſt be avoided, as well as in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Come to <hi>Decency,</hi> how they ſerve for <hi>Decency</hi> I know not. I think <hi>light of Scripture, light of Nature,</hi> and common approved <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cuſtom</hi> ſhould be <hi>rules</hi> for Decency, not mens bare <hi>wills.</hi> For then ſome men will appoint ſuch Ceremonies of ſuch a colour, and ſuch a Form; and he ſaith the worſhip of God cannot be decently performed without them. Another appoints Ceremonies of a contrary colour, and different Form, and ſaith the Worſhip cannot be performed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently without them. So many <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>VVills,</hi> ſo many Rules for Decency, that we ſhall never know when the Worſhip of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed decently. For the Woman to be vailed, as the note of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, was the <hi>civil cuſtom</hi> before the Worſhip of God was known in <hi>Corinth;</hi> for the woman now to lay it by, was <hi>undecent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That is <hi>decent,</hi> the contrary to which is <hi>undecens;</hi> but for a Miniſter to pray without a Surplice is not undecent. You know how
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98093:25"/>many foreign Churches will not uſe it; what then? is the Worſhip of God therefore performed undecently in all thoſe Churches? Nay, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your own Sons; the chief Gentleman in my Pariſh, and a Son of your Church told me, <hi>I think you are as decent and more decent in your Gown and Caſſock, than you are in a Surplice.</hi> I have ſpoken with ſeveral Miniſters, Conformiſts, and they all tell me, they would not care if they were all thrown out of the Church; only they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore they uſe them. But were they ſuch things as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Worſhip could not be decently performed, they would not ſpeak ſo ſlightly of them, and wiſh them thrown out; they are men of reaſon, fit to judg of <hi>decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Decency is of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> it <hi>muſt</hi> be; the command and reaſon for it are clear; then we muſt have a neceſſity put upon theſe, if Worſhip cannot be decently performed without them.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Decency is as neceſſary in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> as in the <hi>Desk;</hi> I hope there is the Worſhip of God in Prayer and Preaching as well as in the Desk; but always I ſaw the Surplice put off, when the Miniſter aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends the Pulpit, unleſs a Sacrament were to be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Decency is neceſſary in our Family-worſhip, muſt we then have a peculiar garment to put on when we pray in our Families?</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. They cannot be uſed to <hi>ſignifie</hi> Decency; for the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any outward ſign or ceremony, does not come into my <hi>eye,</hi> but my <hi>underſtanding;</hi> but if Decency lye in the whiteneſs and fineneſs of the Linnen, I ſee it with my eye.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Order,</hi> I know not how theſe help here; what <hi>diſorder</hi> there was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> Chap. 11.33, 34. declares; and what <hi>diſorder</hi> among the Prophets is intimated <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.33. there was very great reaſon for this Rule; but I hope very good Order may be in the Church without a <hi>Surplice,</hi> or <hi>Croſs,</hi> or <hi>Kneeling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 391. that the Surplice <hi>properly</hi> ſignifies the <hi>reverence we owe to God,</hi> and the <hi>high eſteem we</hi> have of his Ordinances. This Text then for <hi>Decency</hi> muſt be layed by.</p>
               <p>The next Text I find in Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> is 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.64 <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>For which he had no word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s alſo, who joins <hi>Jacob</hi>'s new Ceremony, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.18. but yet ſaith, <hi>Dee quidem impellente, ſed non expreſſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante, novam Ceremoniam excogitavit;</hi> that is ſufficient, but for this of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſaith it was by <hi>command and inſtinct</hi> from <hi>God. Diodati,</hi> that he was <hi>divinely inſpired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have added more, but Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> lays this extraordinary caſe by as not cogent, <hi>p.</hi> 309.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Carre</hi>'s next, <hi>They had no command for building of Synagogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98093:26"/>
               <p>I anſwer, But they had commands for <hi>their holy Convocations on the Sabbath day,</hi> Levit. 23.3. <hi>Place</hi> muſt be a neceſſary circumſtance, they muſt meet ſome where. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.31. God threatens their <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries</hi> in the Plural number; ſome <hi>Hebrews</hi> interpret <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.4, 8. they burnt <hi>All</hi> the Synagogues. The Temple is mentioned diſtinct, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> in the ſingular number. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their laſt Captivity; it may well refer to the <hi>Babyloniſh,</hi> not to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Palkner,</hi> p. 311, as I ſee Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> in his Letter againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and all our Conformiſts, make uſe of Chriſts <hi>diſcumbing</hi> at the Paſſeover, to ſhew Chriſt his conformity to the <hi>Jewiſh cuſtoms,</hi> departing therein from the firſt Inſtitution. Biſhop <hi>Morl.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 29.</note> words are theſe: <hi>It is certain that Chriſt and his Diſciples ſate at the Paſſover, and this no doubt was according to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church at that time; but it is as certain that this was not the manner according to the firſt inſtitution, which was to eat it ſtanding.</hi> Read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. thus he proves we ought to <hi>kneel</hi> at the Sacrament, though Chriſt and his Apoſtles <hi>ſate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Twice we have the word <hi>certain,</hi> and it is certain there is no ſuch word as <hi>ſtanding</hi> in the Text, which I have read ſeveral times, as he bids us.
<note place="margin">Harmon. c. 129.</note> 
                  <hi>Janſenius</hi> ſaith, they might have their <hi>loins girt, feet ſhod, ſtaff in hand,</hi> and yet <hi>ſit,</hi> and ſitting at that time might be their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he thinks from <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.33. Surely the <hi>Jews</hi> did not tear the meat from the bones like dogs; how then they could hold their ſtaves in their hands, and cut their meat when they were in haſte, I cannot well tell</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is very obſervable that the Jeſuits, <hi>Maldon.</hi> and <hi>a Lapide,</hi> and <hi>Gerhard</hi> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> abroad, are more wary what they write concerning Chriſt, than are our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conformiſts; for they all conclude that Chriſt kept the Paſſover according to the <hi>Law,</hi> not <hi>Jewiſh cuſtoms.</hi> If <hi>Joſiah</hi> gave ſuch charge, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.21. <hi>That the Paſſover be kept as it was written in the Book of the Covenant;</hi> Shall Chriſt come ſhort of <hi>Joſiah?</hi> Hence the Jeſuit <hi>a Lapide</hi> agrees with <hi>Gerhard</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> that Chriſt eat the Paſſover <hi>ſtanding,</hi> but his <hi>diſcumbing</hi> was at the other Supper.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Moſt of the Learned that I ſee, as <hi>Jun. Tremel. Rivet, Beza, Scaliger, Paraeus, Piſcator, Grotius, Ainſworth, Diodati, &amp;c.</hi> do all agree, that God appointed the geſture of <hi>ſtanding;</hi> only for that firſt Supper in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as all the other circumſtances noted in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. all ſetting forth perſons in <hi>haſte,</hi> but were never uſed after, when they came to <hi>reſt</hi> in <hi>Canaan.</hi> If they did ſo. I doubt not but it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of God; but indeed there is no geſture mentioned
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98093:26"/>in the Law that I read of. Nor ſhall all the Rabinical men in the world make me believe that Chriſt would depart from the Inſtitution of God, to conform to any <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom; muſt we needs caſt a blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, to juſtifie our own inventions?</p>
               <p>I know no man that maketh ſitting <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Sacrament, as Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> ſuppoſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 474. and as ſtrange is his next ſuppoſition of a Feaſt without Bread or Wine, (or Ale or Beer with us.) For our parts, 'tis all one to us, <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>kneel;</hi> but that we find as it was a Supper, ſo it was a <hi>Supper-geſture</hi> Chriſt uſed with his Apoſtles, there is no other geſture recorded; what geſture our Lord uſed when he bleſſed the Elements, I do not inquire, we ſtand or kneel in Prayer; but the Text ſaith, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.18. <hi>They ſate and eat</hi> at his own Supper, as well as at the Paſſover; for ought I can read the Scripture mentions this geſture <hi>only</hi> at his <hi>eating.</hi> If you can find any Evangeliſt ſpeak otherwiſe, name him. I doubt not, were there any ſuch controverſie or queſtion among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and their <hi>Alcoran</hi> did ſpeak but ſo much for one ſide, as our Bible doth in this, they would give ſo much honour to their <hi>Alcoran</hi> to determine the queſtion on that ſide which it did moſt favour; but it ſeems we cannot give that honour to our Holy Bible, as the <hi>Turk</hi> will to his <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is all one to us to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>kneel;</hi> one geſture is as eaſie as the other. Till <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was hatching, <hi>kneeling</hi> was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known in the Church, but for ſome time of the year it was <hi>forbidden;</hi> much leſs was it contended for: and ſuch puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them who refuſe it, as amongſt us. The Popiſh party blame us for <hi>kneeling,</hi> denying their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That your <hi>Kneelers</hi> worſhip Chriſt in and by the Elements, the great contenders for kneeling have confeſſed,
<note place="margin">Pag. 167.</note> as the Author of the diſpute <hi>againſt Engliſh Popiſh Ceremonies,</hi> have ſhewn out of Dr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and <hi>Paybody</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> upon which he undertakes to prove that kneeling in the act of receiving the Lords Supper is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> urged the ſame,
<note place="margin">Treaſure out of Rubbiſh, p. 65. See more there.</note> that kneeling in the act of receiving the Lords Supper, being a bodily religious adoration of God before a creature, with reſpect unto it, having no ſpecial allowance from God, was unlawful; when this was urged before Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> he found more favour from the <hi>Biſhop</hi> than we can.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Reverence in Gods worſhip we do commend as much as any. I wiſh ſometimes that which men call <hi>Reverence</hi> be not <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But was <hi>David</hi> ſuch an irreverent perſon, when he <hi>ſate</hi> before the Lord in <hi>Prayer,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18, 27. all the Verſions hold to the word <hi>ſate,</hi> and that at this time when his heart was enlarged from the ſenſe of Gods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98093:27"/>love. Cannot I pray reverently, when I lye upon my bed? and may we not as <hi>reverently</hi> receive the ſigns of the Lords body and blood, while we <hi>ſit</hi> at his Supper? Cannot we know our own hearts? Who more profane in their converſation, and deſpiſers of the commands of Chriſt, than moſt of theſe, who can kneel at Sacraments? Upon the ſame ground, <hi>i.e. Reverence,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not put the Bread in the Sacrament into the peoples <hi>hands</hi> (though <hi>Maldonate</hi> grants for a long time the Church did ſo) but into their <hi>mouths</hi> forſooth, <hi>Multo plus habet reverentiae,</hi> Mat. 26.26.</p>
               <p>But it is far from my intention to produce any <hi>new</hi> arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Ceremonies, when there are ſo many produced by Dr. <hi>Ames Didochevius,</hi> and divers others. It is very obſervable what Mr.
<note place="margin">Schol. &amp; pract. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. 2 par. p. 93, 94.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeans</hi> an acute Schoolman and Conformiſt in former times, who cenſured the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> as ſharply as any, and wrote againſt them, while he had read but one ſide, as he ſaith, and was a ſtranger to what the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> could ſay for themſelves, their adverſaries repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their objections and anſwers ſo weak, and ridiculous) hath left upon record. When the Parliament began, he intended to write a full vindication of the Diſcipline and Ceremonies of the then Church of <hi>England,</hi> to which end he read all ſuch Books of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> as he could procure: <q rend="inline">Upon the peruſal of them, ſaith he, I ſoon found that their adverſaries moſt diſingenuouſly miſrepreſented all that they ſaid; that they refuſed to join iſſue with them in the ſtate of the queſtion; that they came not up to an ordinary grapple with them with their Arguments; and that they ſeldom regularly repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the ſolutions which were given to their objections; and this (ſaith he) quickly produced an alteration in my judgment, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will do ſo too in all that will make ſuch an impartial ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter as I have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ingenuous confeſſion of that learned man, making excuſe for what he had written againſt the <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this with the judgment of the learned and pious <hi>VVhitaker,</hi> as I ſee him quoted, by <hi>Maccovius</hi> upon this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Q.
<note place="margin">Theol. loc. Q. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether when we receive the Lords Supper, ſhould we</hi> kneel, ſtand <hi>or</hi> fit?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Reſpondet Whitakerus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Maccovius,</hi> to kneel <hi>doth not only exclude the Rites of the Inſtitution, but doth much violate the ſecond Commandment concerning ſhunning Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſtand <hi>about the Lords-Table, doth partake of the Rites, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts nothing from the Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to partake,</hi> ſitting <hi>is the moſt convenient, becauſe by this neither are the rites of Institution violated; nor doth it attract danger of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98093:27"/>or Idolatry; but this geſture is commended by the example of Chriſt himſelf in the firſt Inſtitution, and of the Apoſtles after the Inſtitution.</hi> Thus he; with whom <hi>Maccovius</hi> agrees.</p>
               <p>Before I go any further, let me make uſe of one thing I meet with in the <hi>Fr. Debate,</hi> part 2d. <hi>pag.</hi> 397, 399. this Author finding fault with us, becauſe we charge theſe Ceremonies, as <hi>being additions to the word of God,</hi> contrary to the command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. (yea, Sir, I own the argument) he anſwers us: <hi>Theſe words,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from the old ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> Mr. Ainſworth, <hi>you reſtrain to worſhip, when as the Text ſpeaks of the whole Law.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Judicial as well; but the Jews never thought that no particular Law might be made agreeable to the general Law.</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 421. <hi>To ſave Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Gods Law hath only given us general rules, whereby things are to be ordered in the Church; according to which our Governours are to make particular Laws, and we are to obey them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, as to Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> whatever were ſome of his private opinions, his learning and piety command reſpect. Whether the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial</hi> Law be there included, I now liſt not to examine. This you have affirmed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſome <hi>general</hi> rules which the Lord hath preſcribed in his word, or <hi>general Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Our Governours may make <hi>particular</hi> Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. But thoſe <hi>particular</hi> Laws muſt be <hi>according</hi> to, and <hi>agreeable with</hi> (both which words you have uſed) the <hi>general</hi> Law of God.</p>
               <p>As when men cut little Creeks to bring water to a place, they let in the water in the great River into theſe leſſer Creeks.
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> Dr. <hi>Templer</hi>'s ſimilitude of gold being beaten out, aims at this. <hi>Now let Conformity ſtand or fall, according to this ſaying of our adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then produce you that <hi>general</hi> Law of God, wherein he giveth liberty in <hi>general</hi> to ordinary Miniſters in his Church, to compoſe and impoſe their Forms of prayer upon all his other Miniſters whom he hath given gifts ſufficient for that office, and tye them up to their Forms and ſyllables in their Adminiſtrations. Upon this <hi>general</hi> Law your Church in <hi>England</hi> have made your <hi>particular</hi> Law, and impoſed your Forms. The <hi>French</hi> Church have made <hi>their particular</hi> Laws, and impoſed their Forms. The <hi>Dutch</hi> theirs; and ſo on. I pray, Sir, keep to the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Produce the <hi>general</hi> Law, where God hath given <hi>men</hi> that power to invent, inſtitute, and adjoin Religious myſtical Ceremonies to his worſhip. Upon which <hi>general</hi> Law, <hi>Rome</hi> makes her <hi>particular</hi> Laws, and impoſe hers; the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes her <hi>particular</hi> Laws, and impoſes hers; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> make their particular Laws,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98093:28"/>and impoſe theirs. (I hear but of few of other Proteſtant Churches that have ſuch Ceremonies, if any at all), and without theſe God ſhall have no worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the third, I know not whether this Author be of that mind, that God hath left us only a general Law for the Government of the Church, but appointed no particular Form of Government, as the learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath aſſerted.</p>
               <p>But for the two former we expect this Author to tell us where we ſhall find thoſe two <hi>general</hi> Laws.</p>
               <p>That common Evaſion, <hi>Though theſe things be not according to the word, yet they are not contrary to the word,</hi> will not ſerve the turn. Yea this Author quite overthrows that diſtinction.</p>
               <p>For he tell us, <hi>Our Governours particular Laws muſt be according to, and agreeable to the general Law of God.</hi>

               <p>A Law is a <hi>poſitive</hi> thing, ſo are Governours particular Laws, then ſo muſt the general Law be. To ſay <hi>not contrary to the word,</hi> what Law is this? <hi>Non ens</hi> is no Law. How can theſe particular Laws be ſaid to be <hi>according</hi> to the Law, and <hi>agreeable</hi> with the Law, when no ſuch Law can be found? If the Law can be found, then that diſtinction is but vain.</p>
               <p>Though this Author hath ſaid enough, yet becauſe this diſtinction is ſo common in their mouths; I will but add a few Scriptures in which we ſhall find an injunction laid upon us, that in matters concerning God, our duty towards him, we look that all things be <hi>according</hi> to his word.</p>
               <p>The firſt Text is, <hi>col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi> according (though we read <hi>after,</hi> that makes no difference, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with an Accuſative Caſe, <hi>ſecundum) to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men;</hi> according <hi>to the rudiments of the world, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Expoſitors differ about thoſe words, <hi>vain deceit:</hi> I ſhall not trouble my ſelf nor the Reader about them; but by <hi>Traditions of men,</hi> I ſee generally they underſtand thoſe ſuperſtitious cuſtoms which have only mans authority for their inſtitution, ſuch as the Phariſaical Traditions. So <hi>Anſelm,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>Baldwin, Davenant, Beza, Gomarus, Diodati,</hi> apply them to the Popiſh worſhip.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>rudiments of the world are,</hi> Gal. 4.9. explains. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the troubles the Apoſtles met with in the Churches, aroſe from theſe three heads. <hi>Philoſophy, Superſtitious Traditions,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. Now all theſe are oppoſed to Chriſt; if they were <hi>according</hi> to them, and not <hi>according</hi> to Chriſt, then they were contrary to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>That they teach no other Doctrine:</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:98093:28"/>upon which words Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> gloſſeth thus: <hi>Timothy was to forbid any to preach, not only Doctrine that was contrary, but that which was beſide that which the faithful had received from the Apoſtles.</hi> And are not the things in queſtion <hi>beſide</hi> that the faithful received from the Apoſtles?</p>
               <p>The third Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve what I have commanded you.</hi> If he hath <hi>commanded</hi> theſe things you impoſe, they ſhall be obſerved, but not elſe. Thus ran the Apoſtles Commiſſion; but we have found an art to interline the Commiſſion, and <hi>what is not expreſly contrary to my command, teach them to obſerve that alſo.</hi> This interlining was under a hedg; ſhould an Ambaſſador thus interline his Commiſſion, it may coſt him dear.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> here demands of us <hi>What command we have to take a Text and gloſs upon it? to pray before and after Sermon? to ſing Davids Pſalms in Engliſh Meeter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſee this Author will play at ſmall games rather than ſtand out; he will join with the <hi>Quakers</hi> for an argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. But, Sir, remember firſt your own words, a <hi>general</hi> Law will help to ſerve our turn as to <hi>Prayer.</hi> We have a command for it; the <hi>time</hi> when, left to our prudence. We think when we are to preach the Word, 'tis a fit time now to confeſs ſins; to beg pardon for ſins, that they may not ſtand in the way to hinder Gods bleſſing; crave for his preſence with us, and aſſiſtance of us in our Preaching <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo after Sermon to bleſs him for mercies, and to beg for his watering of the ſeed ſown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a <hi>Text:</hi> Why did not this Author put the queſtion to Chriſt, what command he had to take a Text and gloſs upon upon it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18, 19. Alſo why <hi>Ezra;</hi> or the Prieſts, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.8. take a Text, <hi>give the ſenſe,</hi> and apply it? We have a command to <hi>teach the word,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. To teach to obſerve what <hi>Chriſt commanded,</hi> Mat. 28.20. Shall we not then take a portion out of that <hi>word?</hi> Shall we not take that command, and open that <hi>word,</hi> firſt <hi>explain</hi> it to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, then apply it to their wills and affections, as doth the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. his Doctrinal part, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. the application of it: how ſhall we ſhew our ſelves <hi>Miniſters of the Word,</hi> but this way? ſhall we take a Text out of our own brains?</p>
               <p>For <hi>Pſalms:</hi> Why did you not ask me for a command to read the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in <hi>Engliſh?</hi> The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts will put this queſtion: Is there not a command to ſing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſongs?</hi> Col. 3.16. Were not <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms of old commanded to be ſung? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.15. and the authority we may learn, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſung then according to the Poetry of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98093:29"/>and ſome have obſerved ſeveral verſes in <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms run in Rimes in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Songs according to the courſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry run in Meeter, ſo we ſing in ſuch verſes as are ſuitable to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ears. If you will teach us to ſing a better way, we will follow your way.</p>

               <p>The fourth Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. with <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. <hi>In vain do they worſhip, teaching for Doctrines the commandments of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> anſwers, <hi>p.</hi> 361.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Tradition did not refer to the order of the publick Worſhip of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I hope it was never the worſe for that; it is well they let the worſhip of God alone, which you do not.</p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Falkner, The queſtion between Chriſt and the Phariſees was, whether it was to be admitted as a Doctrine, that eating with unwaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands defileth a man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So the queſtion between you and us is, Whether this be to be admitted for a Doctrine, <hi>That men may inſtitute Religious, doctrinal, or myſtical Ceremonies, and annex them to the worſhip of God?</hi> You teach this Doctrine firſt as a <hi>general Law,</hi> and then you bring it into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, by inſtituting and commanding <hi>yours</hi> by a particular Law. I know not where you and they differ, only they let Gods worſhip alone, you ſay, and you do not.</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is, that <hi>Chriſt obſerved the Prudential Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But, Sir, do you make <hi>Prudential Rules,</hi> and theſe <hi>Religious, myſtical ceremonies,</hi> all one? for what you have ſaid of Chriſt at the Paſſover, I ſhall add a little more to what I have ſaid already; but becauſe Chriſt ſate in the middle of the Doctors, as others ſate, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and asking queſtions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.46. hence to argue Chriſts confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religious myſtical Ceremonies, is very ſtrange, for a man of your worth and learning.</p>
               <p>At the end of that Section I ſee you condemn the Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>Many of them being Sacramental, and deſigned to be operative of grace, and ſpiritual help</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray, Sir, do not you ſay as much of yours, when you tell us that yours <hi>ſignifie ſuch ſpiritual duties, and have ſuch an aptneſs in them to ſtir up our dull minds to our duty,
<note place="margin">Treaſure out of Rubbiſh, p 43.</note> and help to edifie us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And do not you make them <hi>Sacramental? It is one proper end of Sacraments</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton) by ſtriking of the ſenſes, by outward repreſentative Elements, to teach the underſtanding, help the memory, ſtir
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98093:29"/>up the affections, excite devotion.</hi>—And after, <hi>The Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the nature of a Sacrament, rather under the name ſign (than ſeal) which conſiſteth in the Analogy which is betwixt a ſign determined to ſignifie, and the thing ſignified.</hi> This is ſo true, that I have known Chriſtians who not out of a principle of cavilling, but from a deſire to help their Faith in the uſe of the Sacraments, that have queſtioned whether they were <hi>ſeals,</hi> and have wiſhed for other arguments than uſually we give them, to help them in their doubts, looking on them as not cogent that we give; but for <hi>ſigns,</hi> they queſtioned them not. Thus in our Ceremonies, 1. Here are <hi>ſigns.</hi> 2. Here is a ſpiritual thing, a duty we owe to God, ſignified by them. 3. Theſe ſigns are not dark and dumb, but ſo ſet forth that every man may underſtand what they mean or ſignifie. 4. They are apt means to ſtir up our dull minds to what they do ſignifie, and help to our edification. I think you ſpeak plain enough.</p>
               <p>There is as much given to them as was to Gods own Ceremonies, which did ſignifie ſpiritual graces and duties they owed to God. Yea ſomething more. All may underſtand what yours ſignifie; and they are not dark nor dumb, but fit to ſtir up dull minds.</p>
               <p>That they contain <hi>external worſhip</hi> alſo in them, and ſo are as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith of them, (and theſe you took from the Papiſts), <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniae ſunt pars quaedam cultus Divini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine and true worſhip, I think may be thus deſcribed, <hi>It is ſome act commanded by God, in which we do reverently acknowledg his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, immediately ſerving, and having communion with him therein: whether that act be ſuch as we immediately offer up to him, (as Prayers, Sacrifices, &amp;c.) or ſuch as we offer from God in his name unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as Preaching and Sacraments, &amp;c.)</hi> ſome give other deſcriptions, but I think this will hold.</p>
               <p>This Worſhip having the Authority and Command of God to warrant it, is <hi>true Worſhip.</hi> If it hath not, but only mans invention and authority, it may be called Divine worſhip in one ſenſe, but it is <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, ſuperſtition,</hi> and <hi>falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>teaching,</hi> is worſhip: <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 15.9. It is <hi>me</hi> they pretend to worſhip, this was in <hi>teaching;</hi> but the worſhip was vain.</p>
               <p>God teacheth us two ways: 1. By his <hi>Word.</hi> 2. By <hi>Signs.</hi> By the laſt the Phariſees taught ſpiritual things by their waſhings; as God taught by his waſhings in the Law, ſo do you teach us by your Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; and it ſeems very lively. Now all actions whereby ſpiritual duties are taught in Gods ſolemn worſhip, are acts whereby God is worſhipped; and ſuch acts are worſhip; as all acts whereby he is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are obedience.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98093:30"/>
               <p>Some argue thus: Thoſe external Ceremonies whoſe proper uſe is the honouring of God, are external worſhip; but the Ceremonies in queſtion are ſuch: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Others thus:</p>
               <p>All external Ceremonies in their nature formally elicited from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are <hi>external worſhip;</hi> but ſuch are the Ceremonies in queſtion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are external worſhip. So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpake plainly and honeſtly, when he calls them <hi>parts of Divine worſhip.</hi> Hence I ſee not how the diſtinctions Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> makes about <hi>ſignificative ſigns,</hi> do help at all; but we are ſtill as high as God was, and plainly <hi>add to his word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> I think no man ſo abſurd to limit it only to that particular caſe in the 19th. <hi>ver.</hi> but this is a ſtanding Rule in all caſes concerning God, and our duty to him. <hi>According to this word,</hi> hence Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> thus Paraphraſeth, <hi>If any man ſpeaketh either without, or againſt this word, it is becauſe he hath not the true light of grace and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in him.</hi> Apply this to both the Queſtions, and tell us <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to which word do they ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The laſt Texts, thoſe famous Texts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh.</hi> Addition ſpeaks defect of <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the Law-giver, that he is not wiſe enough to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Creatures, nor how to provide for his own Worſhip, but we muſt ſupply the want of <hi>his</hi> with <hi>our</hi> wiſdom; and intrencheth alſo upon his <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Texts Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> anſwer different ways: Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> p. 56. tells us, <hi>This we count ſuperſtition,</hi> ſupra ſtatutum, <hi>to add any thing to Gods Law, or to be too ſtrict in tying our ſelves to more than God requireth of us.</hi> But foreſeeing how this Text will be turned upon the things impoſed, he with the other Conformiſts plow with the Popiſh Heifers, uſing the ſame diſtinctions that <hi>Vaſquez, Bellarmine, Cor. a Lapide,</hi> uſed to defend their fopperies.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>preſerving</hi> and <hi>corrupting</hi> addition; a <hi>circumſtantial</hi> and an <hi>eſſential</hi> addition; the two laſt he condemns; <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>corrupting</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> addition.</p>
               <p>To which it is anſwered: 1. To your <hi>preſerving</hi> addition; it is a <hi>corrupting</hi> addition, becauſe it is <hi>addition.</hi> Deny the <hi>Genus,</hi> and you deny the <hi>Species.</hi> Addition is denied. <hi>Particular</hi> Laws exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods <hi>general</hi> Law, are no additions.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Find us ſuch a diſtinction of <hi>detraction,</hi> or <hi>diminiſhing,</hi> and ſhow us how there may be a lawful detraction from the word. Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diminiſhing are equally forbidden in the Text.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98093:30"/>
               <p n="3">3ly. There is no preſerving addition brought into the Worſhip of God, but there is another <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>will</hi> brought in beſides Gods: Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> tells us of additions, <hi>the better to inforce the command, the better to perform the ſervice of God.</hi> We read of a <hi>betterneſs</hi> that doth accede to the Worſhip of God by mens inventions and additions; doth not this reflect upon the Law-giver, that he hath not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his own Worſhip? Let but his Worſhip be performed <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to what is written, and there will be no want found of any thing <hi>beſides</hi> what is written.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. No addition could ſo properly be called a <hi>preſerving addition</hi> as that of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>'s ſtaying the Ark to preſerve it from falling, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6, 7. who could uſe this diſtinction better than he?
<note place="margin">De Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern Dei. l. 6 p. 203.</note> but that would not ſave him. Upon which <hi>Salvian</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Denique Oza ille Levites Dei, quid contra mandatum coeleſte fecit, quod vacillantem Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam Domini ſuſtinere tentavit? nihil enim hinc erat lege praceptum, &amp; ſtatim dum ſuſtinebat extinctus eſt. Non quia ut videtur ad ſpeciem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumaci aliquid, aut in officioſa ſaltem mente commiſerit. ſed ipſo officio inofficioſus fuit, qui injusta praeſumpſit. Salvian</hi> knew well enough the Law about the carrying the Ark; but in this caſe when the <hi>Ark is in danger of falling,</hi> what Law is there, elſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> would not have touched it? He aims at this to prove <hi>that there is nothing belongs to God ought to be esteemed light.</hi> Good intentions here will not ſerve.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly The <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their <hi>waſhings, &amp;c.</hi> did but ſignifie that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, purity, cleanſing from ſin, which God ſignified in the <hi>waſhings</hi> he commanded. So they did but <hi>inforce</hi> the command, as Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>For his ſecond Diſtinction, <hi>circumſtantial</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> addition: <hi>Eſſential</hi> additions by no means he will admit, that is indeed againſt the Text. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> told us before, that <hi>Solomon</hi> built an <hi>Altar</hi> more than ever God appointed. And Mr. <hi>Falkntr</hi> will tell us anon, that <hi>David</hi> would build a <hi>Temple</hi> of his own head, and God never appointed it, they had no warrant for theſe, but theſe were <hi>eſſential</hi> parts of the Ceremonial worſhip. By theſe then we may make <hi>eſſential</hi> additions to the Worſhip of God; theſe were the higheſt pieces of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial worſhip, for the <hi>Altar</hi> ſanctified the Sacrifice; and for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it is well known.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. I cannot ſee how the Church can add any circumſtances of her own creating to the Worſhip of God. If ſhe may make one <hi>new</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance and add to the Worſhip of God, ſhe may make a thouſand, and be changing every week if ſhe will, I know no word to forbid her.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98093:31"/>
               <p>But ſtill I cannot ſee how Ceremonies, ſuch as are in the queſtion, can be but <hi>circumſtances.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. No circumſtance hath a myſtical ſignification of any ſpiritual grace or duty. If it hath a ſpiritual ſignification, it is by ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Divine Inſtitution; then it ceaſeth to be a circumſtance. <hi>Place</hi> in it ſelf is a circumſtance, but <hi>ſuch a place</hi> as the <hi>Temple,</hi> is more than a circumſtance, it is eſſential to Ceremonial-worſhip by a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The Ceremonies of the Law which ſignified that purity, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ought to be in Saints, were not circumſtances; and theſe do the ſame. Theſe Ceremonies impoſed upon us are not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, but Doctrinal, and of Moral ſignification.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Circumſtances cannot well be ſaid to be ſubject to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where then ſhall we end? but myſtical ceremonies are ſubject to <hi>time, place, order, decency, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Circumſtances are common to civil actions, as <hi>place, time, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, decency;</hi> but theſe Ceremonies are annexed only to the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Circumſtances are <hi>neceſſary, inſeparable</hi> from the Worſhip of God, as <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> order and decency ought to be; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, <hi>virtute praecepti;</hi> but theſe are ſeparable, and of no <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Peter Lumbard</hi> puts no <hi>neceſſity</hi> in the Popiſh Ceremonies, as you may clearly ſee in his inquiring into the nature of Baptiſm, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>D.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Circumſtances depend not on the bare <hi>will</hi> of man; but theſe Ceremonies depend wholly on <hi>mans will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7ly. The ordering of circumſtances in particular, is not determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Holy Scripture. I do not ſay what the infinite wiſdom of God could have done; but upon ſuppoſition of the bounds which God did ſet to his written word. Circumſtances are many, and ſo changeable, that to ſet down the ordering of every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that muſt occur in the Church and Worſhip of God to the end of the world, would have hindered our Pocket Bibles. <hi>Individua ſunt Infinita.</hi> But for ſignificant Ceremonies, all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ſet down, to the pins of the Tabernacle; and if God had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ceremonies as we do, he could have ſet down twice as many as Popery affords.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. Theſe myſtical ceremonies are <hi>external worſhip,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but ſo are not <hi>circumſtances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> evades theſe Texts in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> telling us, as the Author of the <hi>Er. Deb.</hi> that the Text concern'd the <hi>Judicial Law</hi> as well. This I have ſpoken to before.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98093:31"/>
               <p>Alſo he tells us, <hi>That divers things referring to the worſhip of God,
<note place="margin">Pag. 360.</note> were allowably, under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, ordered as matters of decency and expediency by humane prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, this reaches not our Queſtion; we are inquiring for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſuch Ceremonies as your Preface, and our Queſtion from thence, treat of; elſe I yielded before, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in every particular circumſtance. But M. <hi>Falkner</hi> refers us to a former Section, where he had inſtanced in ſuch things. At <hi>p.</hi> 311. I find there he begins,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> With the <hi>diſcumbing geſture</hi> at the Paſſover, which they changed from <hi>standing.</hi> To this I ſpake before.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. He inſtanceth in the <hi>white garments</hi> that the <hi>Levites</hi> did wear, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.27. <hi>For which there was no direction given in the word; yet the Scripture ſpeaks of the allowableneſs of theſe Levitical gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But the Queſtion is, Whether theſe Levitical garments were ordained by <hi>men</hi> to ſignifie a <hi>ſpiritual duty</hi> they owed to God, and were to ſtir up their dull minds to their duty, and to <hi>edifie</hi> them? If not, they reach not the Queſtion; but of this not a word in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanctius</hi> (1 Sam. 2.) conceives, and others with him, that theſe were not holy garments which <hi>Samuel</hi> while a <hi>child</hi> did wear, and <hi>David</hi> alſo wore when he danced before the Ark, who was not of the <hi>Prieſts Order.</hi> And certainly they knew the garments of the Levites to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, elſe they would not have dared to have uſed them, when God had ſo lately made a breach for want of due order; they had ways to know Gods mind that we have not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Levites.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. They were of the ſame Tribe with the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Their work was about the holy things of God, as was the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. There was nothing determined about the apparel or garments of the Levites by God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. neither for <hi>matter,</hi> whether linnen or woollen; nor for the <hi>colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. But yet <hi>black</hi> colour was not, I conceive, allowable about the Temple worſhip. The <hi>bread of Mourners,</hi> Hoſ. 9.4. was but unclean; hence the Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.14. and that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> Levit. 10.19. when there was ſuch a cauſe of mourning, did not eat. God required <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> in his worſhip and ſervice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Whiteneſs</hi> was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that betokeneth <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> in all ſorts of perſons, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Let thy garments be always white.</hi> We find a threatning againſt the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marims,</hi> Zephan. 1.4. thoſe <hi>black</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Atrati,</hi> becauſe clothed in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98093:32"/>
                  <hi>black.</hi> So <hi>Schindl. Pagn. Buxtorf. Vatablis, Druſius, Jun. &amp; Tremel.</hi> God had appointed <hi>white</hi> in his Prieſts and Worſhip. Lay all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we may ſee good reaſon why the Levites choſe <hi>white</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſo <hi>David</hi> partly for <hi>lightneſs,</hi> and the <hi>joy,</hi> now dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Ark. So that this inſtance doth not yet prove the queſtion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I do not ſee how the carrying the Ark, or <hi>Davids</hi> dancing were parts of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>His <hi>third</hi> inſtance, the <hi>Altar of Witneſs made by the two Tribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I know not how this reaches the caſe, for that was not intended with any reſpect to <hi>Divine worſhip;</hi> the ten Tribes feared it, and ſent their meſſengers about it; but the <hi>two Tribes</hi> proteſted againſt it, they had no ſuch intent, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.29. <hi>God forbid, &amp;c.</hi> There was <hi>no</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and our queſtion is about Religious humane Ceremonies, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Worſhip.</p>
               <p>His <hi>fourth</hi> Inſtance, <hi>the Temple it ſelf deſigned by</hi> David, <hi>and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God,</hi> 1 King. 8.17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this be followed, then you will tell us that ſomething <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Worſhip of God may be invented by <hi>man</hi> (as I touched before) will you, Sir, affirm it? I am ſure the Temple was <hi>eſſential</hi> to their Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Place</hi> is but a <hi>circumſtance</hi> of worſhip; if the place were more ſplendid and ſumptuous, it was but a <hi>place</hi> ſtill. But I pray did <hi>David</hi> intend to build a <hi>place</hi> to have that myſtical ſignification that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had? prove this, I pray, elſe you reach not the queſtion; there is nothing of this appearing in the Chapter. <hi>David</hi> was moved from the zeal he bare to the honour of God; the want of this the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> did ground his deſign upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.10. <hi>VVhen he giveth you reſt from all your enemies round about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then there ſhall be a place which your God ſhall chuſe.</hi> To which Text 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.1. anſwers, <hi>When the King ſate in his houſe, and the Lord had given him reſt round about from all his enemies, &amp;c.</hi> then <hi>David</hi> is thinking to prepare a <hi>place;</hi> ſo that <hi>David</hi> had ground for his enterprize; only he was miſtaken as to his enemies, for he had much War after this, and that <hi>Solomon</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as one cauſe why he could not build the Houſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.3. And in the 4th v. <hi>But now the Lord my God hath given me reſt on every ſide, ſo that there is neither adverſary nor evil occurrent.</hi> So that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> had reſpect to that Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. I know no error in it, if I ſhould ſay God alſo inſpired <hi>David.</hi> God had a great councel, a decree of his to reveal to <hi>David,</hi> of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Houſe, and of Chriſt to come of him after the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23. he puts <hi>David</hi> upon it, (having alſo declared his purpoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98093:32"/>before in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.10, 11.) and takes occaſion from this love of his to God, to open his love and decree towards <hi>David,</hi> that God did inſpire him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bradwardin</hi> doth intimate, <hi>de cauſ. Dei, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 25. thoſe words in the fifth verſ. <hi>Shalt thou build me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Diodati</hi> thinks to be words of admiration, rather than reprehenſion. And the 7th. v. <hi>Spake I word, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">God had often ſaid in his Law, that he would chuſe himſelf a place, but had not expreſſed where or when it ſhould be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lovingly admoniſheth <hi>David</hi> to wait for this expreſſion.</q> Thus <hi>Diodati.</hi> But this ſtill intimateth that <hi>David</hi> took the word for his ground. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil I find a place for the Lord. David</hi> uſeth the ſame word which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His next Inſtance is in the Synagogue-worſhip, in which they were left in ſome particulars to their own prudential determinations, which the Chriſtian Church is not. Inſtance is given in their Synagogal Officers, admitted by impoſition of hands, when neither their office and authority, nor their admiſſion were determined in the Scripture. For their Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by impoſition of hands, this he proves out of</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden. For their power and office, he proves that Chriſt owned it,</hi> Mat. 23.2, 3. <hi>Though the Scripture had determined nothing about it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, Sir, belongs to another queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church (and if <hi>there,</hi> then why not in the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi>) Chriſt did approve of any Officers in the Church, that were not of Gods, but Humane appointment, to preach his word Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? this is a very conſiderable queſtion, but 'tis not ours at this time; ſo that this is not <hi>ad idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Yet as to the thing it ſelf: Impoſition of hands upon men ſet apart to office, was no Humane Invention; that, Sir, you know, it was Gods own appointment. But whether all that taught in the Synagogues were firſt Officers. 2. And <hi>thoſe that had only mans authority for th eir Inſtitution:</hi> 3. <hi>And theſe had admiſſion by Impoſition of hands.</hi> Theſe are different queſtions, and here we muſt have <hi>Scripture-light</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us; as for Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> we regard him not, nor <hi>Scaliger,</hi> whatever he ſaith of our <hi>ignorance,</hi> which Quotation of yours out of him, I obſerved well when I read him. We are upon things that concern God; Humane Quotations, and ſo whatever you bring from Fathers and others, I look on them as a Cypher; as the Cypher may ſtand, it ſignifies much, and as it may ſtand, it ſignifies nothing. Firſt give me a Scripture, then give me Humane teſtimony ſuitable to it, and it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies much. Yea, if there be a Scripture not ſo clear and plain as ſome
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98093:33"/>are, yet may fairly carry ſuch a ſenſe, and there be not another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that doth plainly oppoſe that ſenſe, here the practiſe of the Churches next to the Apoſtles, and ſo long ſince, ſhall carry me into that ſenſe. Which I deſire the Reader to conſider and judg of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe I ſhall make uſe of it afterwards; but all mens opinions, and Churches practiſes, without a Scripture, are but a Cypher before or without a figure to me, they ſignifie nothing. I know very well that <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles too have a nature that is croſs to God in every Commandment; our enmity will not let any command eſcape, but even in his Inſtituted Worſhip where there is the leaſt temptation, there it will ſhew it ſelf, 'tis not handſome enough as God appoints it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we like Apes may dreſs it. If <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> could have given us the practiſes of ſuch a Church where this root of enmity was not, then I ſhould have liſtned to them very much.</p>
               <p>But to the Argument:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all thoſe who did teach in the Synagogues were <hi>Officers</hi> thus conſtituted, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells us, I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> will not affirmit; the example of our Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.15, 16. ſhews the contrary. <hi>Grotius</hi> we can believe, for he ſpeaks with the Scripture:
<note place="margin">De Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. p. 374</note> ſaith he, <hi>Notandum in ſynagogis Judaicis unicuique exercitato in ſacris literis (erant autem ferme omnes, exceptis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<note place="margin">Pag. 375.</note> 
                  <hi>qui mos hodie apud nos viget) conceſſum fuiſſe ſacras Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras Interpretari.</hi> Afterwards he gives us the difference between the Interpreters of the <hi>Law</hi> in the Synagogue, and of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the Church: <hi>In ſynagoga docebant quotquot</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>habebant</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in Eccleſia, probati quique, &amp; honorem teſtimonio adopti ut Tertullia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus loquitur,</hi> i.e. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that according to him they were not Ordained. The reaſonof the difference he alſo giveth thus: <hi>Not only becauſe the Preaching of the Goſpel is of more moment than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Law, but becauſe in the Chriſtian Church the Preachers of the word are likewiſe diſpenſers of the Sacraments, but the Maſters of the Synagogues adminiſtred no Sacraments, no not Circumciſion.</hi> This is croſs to <hi>Selden.</hi> I ſhall yield to <hi>Grotius,</hi> having Scripture on his ſide, the other not. All that teach in the Chriſtian Church are Ordained; not ſo in the Synagogue.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly.
<note place="margin">Weems, exp. Cer. Law, 122.</note> As to the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> all the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not <hi>Teaching-Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees;</hi> not <hi>Poruſhim</hi> but <hi>Paruſhim.</hi> Some were but Laick-Phariſees, as we may call them, ſaith <hi>VVeems.</hi> Now ſince all of them were not <hi>Teachers,</hi> and it is agreed by the Learned that many of the Prieſts and Levites were Phariſees; and <hi>Gerhard</hi> proves from ſeveral verſes here, that theſe were ſuch, no private perſons, but perſons in Office; and <hi>he</hi> with <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi> ground this Text and Command of Chriſt upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16. they had <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98093:33"/>
               <p n="3">3ly. Nor will we refuſe to hear thoſe who preach the Goſpel ſoundly (as if they expounded the Law truly, Chriſt would have them heard) though we judg their Ordination mixed with corruption, or doubt whether they be rightly called; their Ordination being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, either becauſe ſome are Ordained by ſuch, who as <hi>ſuch</hi> are no Officers of Chriſt; and others without <hi>Impoſition of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> underſtands this Chair <hi>de Cathedra Legiſlativa,</hi> and tells us that Chriſt here aſſerts the Authority of the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and exhorts to the obedience of them in lawful things. And <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems to incline this way; and if ſo, this is not to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Inſtance is, <hi>the habit of the Prophets; a rough or hairy garment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But was this annexed and appropriated to Divine Worſhip? or was it that garment they wore daily, where ever they went? ſo a Miniſter in his Gown and Caſſock, if you will make a civildi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I like it very well; but this touches not the queſtion; for the Garments in the Synagogal Aſſemblies, out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> we little regard them, if they were uſed for a Religious myſtical ſignification (which doth not appear, and ſo reaches not the queſtion); if ſo, you may tell us of the <hi>Fact,</hi> but our queſtion is, <hi>de Jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third Inſtance is, from the <hi>decent geſtures commanded and uſed in</hi> Nehem. 8. <hi>&amp; ch.</hi> 9 <hi>Standing up, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We like <hi>decent geſtures</hi> very well; and if that were all, we will ſtand up at the reading of the <hi>Law,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> too; we ſhall make no difference, being all Divinely inſpired. Yea, if that will content you, and our health will bear it, we will ſet uncovered too during the time of holy Worſhip; which in theſe times is ſo much in practiſe, and expected, over it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, though I do not like the ground of their uncovering; but the 52 <hi>Injunction</hi> ſhews it was their allowance and cuſtom in Sermon-time to ſit covered; elſe why do the Injunction require that at the naming of Jeſus, <hi>men ſhould uncover their heads?</hi> If they ſate always uncovered, how could they anſwer this?</p>
               <p>His laſt Inſtance, <hi>is their adding of Baptiſm, or waſhing, to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, initiating their Proſelytes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have read indeed of ſuch a practiſe taken up in the latter time of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Johns Baptiſm;</hi> but ſtill, Sir, we want one thing, <hi>and this God approved of;</hi> how prove you that? <hi>quo jure?</hi> by what Divine warrant was it done? If you intended to ſhow us your reading, that is one thing; but if you intended to convince us, you know this is not the way; for you do but prove the <hi>Jews</hi> had as carnal hearts as we, unleſs you can ſhow us that what they did in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98093:34"/>Worſhip was agreeable to that Rule, which is the Law to them, and to us, by which we muſt all be judged.</p>
               <p>Next, Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> comes to <hi>Natural Worſhip,</hi> and ſhows their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms about an <hi>Oath,</hi> which I ſhall take into conſideration when I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Fr. Debate,</hi> where I find an argument againſt us from hence.</p>
               <p>His next, the <hi>Rites</hi> (as he calls them) of <hi>Memorial,</hi> Stones ſet up by <hi>Samuel, Jacob, Joſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But how do theſe reach the queſtion? If they at <hi>London</hi> will erect a Monument that Poſterity may know where that ſore <hi>Judgment</hi> of God (as <hi>Samuels</hi> was <hi>Mercy</hi>) in the deflagration of the City began. If <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> will make a heap of ſtones in the place where they ſware, though it may be neither <hi>Laban</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> ever came to the place again to ſee theſe ſtones, what are theſe to our queſtion? ſo that of <hi>Joſhua;</hi> what ſignification of an Oath is there in a ſtone lying on the ground? they may remember, that in this place <hi>Joſhua</hi> made us ſwear. The ſtone ſerves for a <hi>Witneſs</hi> that there was ſuch a part of Worſhip there celebrated. If <hi>Joſhua</hi> had called <hi>men</hi> of other Nations to hear the Covenant, and witneſs what they ſware, what would you make of thoſe witneſſes to force the queſtion in hand?</p>
               <p>The Stone was a witneſs on both ſides, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.27. for it <hi>hath heard all the words of the Lord which he ſpake unto us;</hi> as well as of <hi>their engagement to God.</hi> The Stone did not <hi>ſignifie</hi> the Oath.</p>
               <p>His next Inſtance is <hi>in the uſe of ſackcloth and aſhes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But were theſe invented among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and uſed by them only in a Religious way, or were they common to others, Heathens as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſhow by a civil cuſtom their <hi>ſubmiſſions, fear, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> they were under, lying low before their ſuperiors; or noting an afflicted ſtate? The ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> come to <hi>Ahab</hi> with <hi>ſackcloth on their loins,</hi> 1 King. 20.31, 32. theſe were no <hi>Jews.</hi> The King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> Jon. 3.8. cauſe <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beaſts</hi> (more than we read of among the <hi>Jews</hi> that I remember) to be clothed with Sackcloth. God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>Moab</hi> with Sackcloth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.37. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> in the name of God, <hi>Joel</hi> 1.13. calls to the Prieſts to lye in Sackcloth. Do but you ſhow us as much for the queſtions in hand, and we ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.19. <hi>put aſhes on her head,</hi> was it upon a Religious account? Who taught the Heathen King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> to ſit in ſackcloth and aſhes? <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.6. did the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and he obeyed them? Still theſe conclude not the queſtion.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>indifferency</hi> of the things which Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> next mentions, I ſhall leave that, till I have conſidered his other Scripture-arguments, for that I only regard.</p>

               <p>He paſſeth on to the New Teſtament, where I ſee Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> and all of them agree in urging the <hi>Holy kiſs,</hi> the <hi>Love-feaſts;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> adds the <hi>Deaconeſs,</hi> which are alterable Rites, though Apoſtolical, and layed by, even by the Nonconformiſts.</p>
               <p>But this ſtill will not prove the queſtion, unleſs you will do it thus: If we may <hi>detract</hi> from the word, then we may add to the word (both are forbidden) but you detract from the word. As indeed this is <hi>Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> the other is poſitive.</p>
               <p>But I pray, Sir, do not you argue from <hi>our ſin</hi> (if we be guilty) to juſtifie <hi>yours.</hi> For if they be indeed of <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> we will take them all up again.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Love-feaſts,</hi> that they were of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as joined to the Lords-Supper, I find nothing to perſwade me to it. <hi>Feaſting</hi> was a civil cuſtom for the maintaining of love, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of the Apoſtles were born. The Apoſtle finds them in uſe, but 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22, 34. he finds fault with them, and takes them away from the Lords Supper. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> both affirm the ſame. If ſome Churches did retain them, yet not all. <hi>Juſt. Mart. Apol.</hi> 2. giving us an account how they performed the worſhip of God on the Lords-day, makes no mention of this, though he doth of the Lords-Supper. And for Feaſting after <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s faſhion, if we adminiſter at noon time; the poor Nonconformiſts uſe to have the poor of the Church to dine with them. So that this reaches not me.</p>
               <p>So for <hi>Kiſſing, men kiſſing men, and women kiſſing women,</hi> which you ſay was meant by their kiſſing, <hi>not men kiſſing women.</hi> This alſo was a civil cuſtom a thouſand of years before any Apoſtle was born; how then this ſhould be called an <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitution</hi> I cannot underſtand. Our civil cuſtom is to give the right-hand, or the hand, and ſignifies the ſame that kiſſing doth; the Apoſtle <hi>modifies</hi> a civil cuſtom of their own; and we ſtand obliged to the ſame duty the Apoſtle intends in it, <hi>even Love without Diſſimulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Deaconeſs,</hi> if it were indeed an office required in all Churches, I think we have done ill to omit it. If the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Can. 11. did remove the Deaconeſſes, as ſome think, we regard no ſuch Councils. The Churches of <hi>Bohemia</hi> did keep up that Office, as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>That it was an <hi>office,</hi> properly ſo called, I queſtion; The <hi>Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was not <hi>ordained,</hi> as were all Church-officers, and that with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands; they who omit Impoſition of hands, let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. <hi>Danaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non tam fuit munus hoc publicum quam ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium aliquod a Diaconis quaeſitum,</hi> ſhe was a help to the Deacon in ſuch
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98093:35"/>thing as were not comely for a Deacon to meddle in, if the Siſters of the Church were ſick. As to this point, in Churches rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, the Deacon takes ſo much care of the ſick, though poor, that as to the Nurſe, Food and Phyſick, there is no want, this I know by good experience. 2ly. <hi>Danaeus</hi> thinks they were helpful at their Love-feaſts to waſh, dreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this end is eaſily anſwered, they being removed. The third was in the entertainment of ſtrangers, waſhing of feet, as in thoſe Countries was their cuſtom; but in our Countries, where there is no ſuch cuſtom, wearing ſhoos as we do, and not ſo hot a Climate, and here all are Chriſtians <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> that end and uſe is laid by. The firſt uſe then only remains, which is anſwered as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> he tells us <hi>dipping</hi> in Baptiſm is out of practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is but very lately then; a Gentleman told me he well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the dipping of Infants; the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>-Book doth not lay it by, but that leaves you to uſe it, or ſprinkling. I thought <hi>Baptizing</hi> had been the command. Can there be no Baptizing but by dipping? will he affirm it, that the Baptizing of the three thouſand in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and the Jaylor and his Family, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. was by <hi>dipping?</hi> It is all one to me whether by dipping or <hi>pouring of water,</hi> Ezek. 36.25. What Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> would gather from the <hi>praying and prophecying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.4. I know not, it is our practiſe he knows, though I have ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter Preaching with his Hat on; would he have it that <hi>Paul</hi> from a <hi>private ſpirit</hi> did give this Rule contrary to the practiſe of other Churches who had uſed to pray and preach co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered? For <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> mentions, I never oppoſed it; nor doth this concern our queſtion.</p>
               <p>For the Decree mentioned in <hi>Act.</hi> 15 which Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> produceth, if that had been well obſerved, much of our trouble might have been ſpared. The Apoſtles and Elders, with the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, Impoſed only things <hi>neceſſary;</hi> that <hi>neceſſity</hi> was antecedaneous to the Decree, either <hi>neceſſary</hi> in themſelves, as <hi>abſtaining from fornication, &amp;c.</hi> or neceſſary by a <hi>poſitive</hi> Law of God long in force, and which the weak believers could not underſtand to be repealed, nor did moſt I believe of them ſo ſee it, till the <hi>Temple</hi> it ſelf, the Head of all was deſtroyed. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> at <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. gives the reaſon, <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day;</hi> to hear <hi>Blood</hi> ſo often for bidden in <hi>Moſes</hi> (yea this near to the ſeventh Command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.4. which Laws if a Heathen did not obſerve he was not permitted to live among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) and now to ſee the believing Gentiles <hi>eating of blood,</hi> &amp;c. what a horrible offence had this been, and hinderance to the Goſpel? Hence the things were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98093:35"/>firſt neceſſary, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Decree; but not neceſſary only becauſe of the Decree. Bleſſed <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks very well to theſe Ceremonies, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>This is a good Rule for Impoſers, <hi>Primum in uno quoque genere eſt menſura reliquorum,</hi> Impoſe only <hi>neceſſary</hi> things.</p>
               <p>For thoſe who refuſe to eat blood at this day from that Decree, I think they err very much. Let them obſerve <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. the reaſon of the Command; and tell me whether they deny the blood which maketh atonement for our ſouls to be ſhed.</p>
               <p>That Decree then commanded no poſitive duty, as our queſtions do, but a forbearance of ſome things in point of ſcandal, which God had forbidden.</p>
               <p>The laſt Scripture I ſee Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> mentions, <hi>is Chriſt his waſhing of</hi> Peters <hi>feet, a</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Paſchal Rite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the <hi>waſhing,</hi> being a thing in civil uſe in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and not in ours, if the thing Chriſt intended in it to which we are ſtrictly bound, will not ſerve, though we uſe not to waſh feet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mode of thoſe Countries, we will take up that alſo, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than omit any of his Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>But that Chriſt uſed it as a <hi>Jewiſh Paſchal Rite,</hi> that is another queſtion, and brings me on to the conſideration of an argument Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> and others out of <hi>Scaliger</hi> make uſe of to prove Chriſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, <hi>as Chriſt his dipping the ſop in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeth, a ſawce they made. His waſhings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here would fall in ſeveral things to conſider, but I muſt not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>As to this Sop, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Maldonate</hi> deny that Chriſt dipped the Sop in the Charoſeth, but in ſome other ſawce at their common Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Yet I queſtion whether they had any other Supper beſide the Paſchal Lamb; a whole Lamb would ſerve thirteen of us to ſup well, though our Climate be colder; I ſee <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> incline to my thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. But if the ſawce <hi>Charoſeth</hi> were made of <hi>Cichory, Lettice,</hi> and other bitter herbs, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, <hi>&amp; aliis neſcio quibus,</hi> and with him agree <hi>Capellus,</hi> then Chriſt kept to the Inſtitution; for the Law was only general, for <hi>Bitterneſſes;</hi> but neither is this ſawce yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Chriſts Table.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. For <hi>waſhings,</hi> there were <hi>Civil, Religious,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> waſhings; let <hi>Scaliger</hi> prove that Chriſt conformed to the Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous waſhings: <hi>They did bleſs God for the waſhing of hands, and then waſhed their hands.</hi> We know how conformable Chriſt was to them in waſhing of hands, but this is waſhing of feet: <hi>More prorſus inſolito,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98093:36"/>ſaith <hi>Gerhard</hi> Great debate there is among Divines when this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, whether <hi>before, after,</hi> or <hi>in</hi> Supper time. <hi>Druſius</hi> finds ſuch a knot here, that he that can untye it, ſhall be to him <hi>Magnus in Oculis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. This waſhing of <hi>Peter</hi> is recorded in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.5. at that Supper; now what if that Supper were not the Paſchal Supper? then all that <hi>Scaliger</hi> and Mr. <hi>Car</hi> with others have built upon it, falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>I had my eye upon thoſe words in the firſt verſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>before the feaſt of the Paſſover;</hi> which made me think the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mentioned in the 2. <hi>v.</hi> could not be the Paſſover; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thoſe words from the firſt verſe to the ſecond verſe to force a mans reaſon to conceive that thoſe words, <hi>Supper being ended,</hi> in the ſecond verſe, to be meant of the Paſchal Supper; but I was fearful to declare my thoughts,
<note place="margin">Gleanings out of Exodus 1. S. 19.</note> till reading Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> I found him fully of my mind, denying any <hi>Charoſeth</hi> at this Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſuch a man on my ſide, I will prove his and my opinion as well as I can.</p>
               <p>Our Bibles in the Margent refer us to <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.2. now to know what time that was <hi>John</hi> means, when he faith, <hi>before the Paſſover, Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>it was two days before the Feaſt of the Paſſover.</hi> So doth <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. but where is Chriſt at this time two days before the Paſſover? <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.3. at <hi>Bethany;</hi> neither <hi>Matthew</hi> nor <hi>Mark</hi> tell us whether it were Dinner or Supper, but that he <hi>ſate at meat;</hi> but <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Supper being ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. While Chriſt is at <hi>Bethany,</hi> the chief Prieſt and Scribes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting how to take him, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now from this Supper goeth <hi>Judas</hi> unto them, who were now conſulting to bargain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I doubt not but there was ſome ſpace of time between <hi>Judas</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain made with the Prieſts, and his delivering Chriſt up to them the Text is plain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.16. <hi>And from that time he ſought opportunity to betray him.</hi> So that he had not opportunity ſo ſoon as he had ſold him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.6. <hi>He ſought opportunity to betray him.</hi> But when then did he make his bargain? <hi>when Satan was entred into him,</hi> Luk. 22.3, 4, 5 when did Satan enter into him? <hi>After the ſop Satan entred into him,</hi> Joh. 13.27. What Supper then was this at which <hi>Judas</hi> received the ſop? not the Paſſover; for the Prieſts conſulted how to take him two days before the Paſſover, while Chriſt is at <hi>Bethany;</hi> but the <hi>opportunity</hi> which he had been ſeeking to make good his bargain, he found it ſo ſoon as Chriſt had eaten the Paſſover, inſtituted his own Supper, and was gone forth; then that could not be the time he made his bargain; ſo the ſop could not be at the Paſſover, for then you will make the time of his <hi>bargain</hi> and <hi>delivery</hi> to be almoſt the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to both the Texts.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98093:36"/>
               <p n="4">4. When Chriſt bad <hi>Judas, Joh.</hi> 13.27. <hi>That thou doeſt, do quickly;</hi> the Diſciples thought the meaning was that <hi>Judas</hi> having the Bag, he bad him <hi>buy thoſe things we have need of againſt the Feaſt,</hi> verſ. 28, 29. What <hi>Feaſt</hi> was that? the Paſſover no queſtion; ſo ſaith <hi>a Lapide, Ad emendum neceſſaria pro inſtante Paſcate.</hi> But if this were the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper at which <hi>Judas</hi> received the ſop, then what need to buy againſt the Feaſt, when the Feaſt was paſt, and Chriſt knew he was now to die?</p>
               <p>I ſee but two things that trouble me, but the ſame doubts are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Gerhard, Maldonate,</hi> and <hi>a Lapide,</hi> who interpret this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Paſſover as others commonly do. To which doubts they have given anſwers, and their anſwers will ſerve me better, than if I ſhould interpret it as they do of the Paſchal Supper. As yet then Chriſt is no Conformiſt.</p>
               <p>Having done with theſe men, now to our good friend the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> in whom I find ſomething more, <hi>p.</hi> 102. he tells us, <hi>We uſe Ceremonies in Divine Worſhip, as in an Oath, laying the hand upon the Book, kiſſing the Teſtament, which are outward ſigns ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying ſwearing though they belong not to the eſſence of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I have heard of ſome, and may be there are more than we are aware of, who will lay their hand on the Book, kiſs it, and do it readily, becauſe they think they do not ſwear, and ſo regard not what you ſay to them; but if you put them to <hi>lift up their hand,</hi> as we read in Scripture they did who ſware, they would not do that, becauſe then they thought they ſhould ſwear indeed; though I do not juſtifie theſe perſons in this, yet if an Oath be of conſequence, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be looked into. A Lawyer tells me he hath ſeen it, and a Gentleman tells me hath ſworn in the Court <hi>by lifting up the hand;</hi> whether the Law binds only to this form of <hi>laying, &amp;c.</hi> I know not, but I could never yet learn the meaning of this form of ſwearing. If the Chriſtians did it in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s time upon the <hi>Book of the Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the <hi>Book of the Law,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> ſaith, to be ſure we find the Scripture mentioning more than one <hi>Form</hi> of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Sometime <hi>Abraham</hi> lifts up his hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. another time we find him, <hi>bidding his ſervant put his hand under his thigh,</hi> Gen. 24.2. that is, <hi>my Maſter made me ſwear.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> makes <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 47.29 31. put <hi>his hand under his thigh.</hi> So <hi>the giving the hand under Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.24. is by ſome interpreted, that the Princes ſware unto <hi>Solomon;</hi> as we take the Oath of Allegiance to our King; the cuſtom of ſeveral Countries is various in this point, in which we are indifferent; though I know ſome refuſe to ſwear at all; unleſs it be by <hi>lifting up the hand;</hi> but the Scripture hath not ſo tyed us up, we ſee.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98093:37"/>
               <p n="2">2ly. But that he ſaith <hi>theſe ſigns belong not to the eſſence of an Oath;</hi> certainly he is miſtaken; theſe ſigns have a cauſal influence into the effect, the Oath. For, he that gives the Oath doth not ſwear; the perſon to whom the Oath is given, ſwears not by <hi>words;</hi> then take away theſe <hi>ſigns,</hi> and where is the Oath?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 220, 221. <hi>He tells us of Ceremonies the Parliament appointed, and Miniſters uſed in giving the ſolemn Oath and Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>Tho whole Congregation uncovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then it ſeems they were not againſt <hi>decent geſtures.</hi> It was in a ſolemn piece of Worſhip of God, at the adminiſtring of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the whole Congregation ſit uncovered, and who oppoſes it?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Standing,</hi> and very meet, not to ſit when they are thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in ſuch a ſolemn manner; we like reverent geſtures well in theſe caſes; the Parents <hi>ſtand</hi> at the Infants baptizing, there is a <hi>Covenant</hi> made.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>It is the right hand;</hi> this and not the <hi>left,</hi> is attributed to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.7. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 98.1. where it is not determined which hand in Scripture we will take, which hand our ſuperiours pleaſe; but if <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum fortior eſt dextra;</hi> why not that?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>The hand muſt be bare;</hi> If the <hi>hand</hi> muſt be lifted up, let us ſee the <hi>hand,</hi> not the <hi>glove.</hi> If <hi>Vaninus</hi> were to ſwear, it may be he hath under his glove ſome writing that he owns no God at all, as he and his Diſciples taught; ſo others might have ſomething quite croſs to the Covenant that did ſwear the contrary, be the Covenant never ſo holy and paſt diſpute, as ſome did queſtion this. Theſe are but trifles.</p>
               <p>But <hi>p.</hi> 106. he tells us, (and this is that which Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> and all make uſe of, as an argument againſt us), <hi>The things commanded are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and remain ſo after they are commanded in their own nature, no neceſſity put upon them.</hi> Upon which, to illuſtrate the ſtrength of his argument, and ſhow the <hi>Knavery</hi> of the non-conforming Miniſters, (for they muſt be the perſons in the <hi>Reddition</hi> whom he intends) he gives his Reader an elegant ſimilitude, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who are a maſter in your family, will have your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants come in to worſhip God at ſuch a time in the Parlor, not in their Frocks, in which they rub'd your horſes heels, but in their Liveries, this is but reaſonable; it is indifferent in it ſelf, all one to God whether the hours be ten or eleven, but you appoint Ten; whether in the Hall or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. If your ſervant would not come in at Ten, or into Parlor, (being thus indifferent) were not this ſervant guilty of contempt, and faulty? If your ſervants were ſuch fools, and cannot underſtand common ſenſe, they are the more to be pitied; but yet thoſe Knaves that abuſed their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98093:37"/>ſimplicity, and inſtilled theſe principles, deſerve to be puniſhed, and put out of his ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I leave you to apply this caſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This apt ſimilitude of the <hi>Frock,</hi> whereby the <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> would illuſtrate the Knavery of the Nonconformiſts, puts me in mind of a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which a Conformiſt and neighbour-Miniſter told me, being about four years ſtanding in the Colledg of <hi>Dublin,</hi> when the thing was done. A Laundreſs bringing home a Scholars Linnen, inſtead of his Surplice, leaves him a Smock, (I ſuppoſe unwittingly), Dr. <hi>Chappel</hi> was then Provoſt (if that be the title they give the Head) of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; if it were that <hi>Chappel,</hi> who was fellow of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Colledg in my time, he was a ſevere man indeed, and fit for Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Bell ringing to Chappel early in Winter-time, the Lad puts on the Smock (and why not? for I ſuppoſe the ſignificancy lyes in the whiteneſs) inſtead of the Surplice; when he comes into Chappel, the paultry boys were fain to ſtop their mouths with their Surplices till Service was done, leſt they ſhould laugh out-right; but when Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was finiſhed, there was no little noiſe made in the Chappel. The Doctor hearing it, ſent to know what the matter was? anſwer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; the Lad is ſent for, he makes his excuſe; but that would not ſerve his turn, the Lad was puniſhed I forgot to ask the kind of puniſhment); as for the Smock, he ſends for an Officer that belonged to the Kitchin, and cauſed a fire to be made, and there burnt the Smock. Had the Doctor ordered it to be burnt to <hi>Tinder,</hi> and not to <hi>aſhes,</hi> he might have made as ſignificant a Ceremony of it, though it was <hi>black,</hi> as his <hi>white</hi> Surplice was. And I may ſay of it as it is ſaid of theſe Ceremonies, <hi>they are ſo ſet forth, that every man may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I commend you Sir, this is like a Diſputant, you have maintained <hi>Eartholomew</hi>-day very ſtoutly. But Sir,</p>
               <p>The Nonconforming Miniſters are not the <hi>Knaves,</hi> as your <hi>Reddition</hi> make them; they hate the <hi>Frock,</hi> it doth ſmell ſo of the Jades in the Stable at <hi>Rome;</hi> they will by no means come into the Parlor with the <hi>Frock;</hi> ſo that he that wears the <hi>Frock</hi> in the Parlor, is either the <hi>Fool</hi> or the <hi>Knave,</hi> according to your Logick.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. We call them <hi>Knaves</hi> who <hi>cheat</hi> the perſons with whom they deal. I do not call you <hi>Knave,</hi> I have learned more <hi>moralily</hi> than ſo, which you ſo much talk of; but that you have cheated your Reader, I ſhall make it appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With that piece of Sophiſtry called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, here are <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Livery, i. e.</hi> your Surplice, put together as if there were no difference, when as we deny it. <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> are but <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> inſeparable from the Worſhip of God; hence 'tis all one to us,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98093:38"/>whether nine, ten, or eleven of the Clock; whether in the Hall or <hi>Parlor;</hi> if it be beſt for edification, or conveniency of the Church, we are very indifferent; but the Livery hath a <hi>moral ſignification,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by men for another end, to put us in mind of our Duty to God, and a means to ſtir up our dull minds to the performance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> your ſimilitude doth not touch the ſtate of the queſtion; the queſtion ſpeaks of one thing, and your ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude argues another.</p>
               <p>That by this <hi>Livery</hi> you muſt underſtand ſome Ceremony, and if any, the <hi>Surplice,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Argutum,</hi> is plain, for that ſuits a Livery beſt; and ſomething you would argue, as you declare when you bid <hi>the Reader make the Reddition.</hi> In this ſenſe your ſimilitude is very apt, it doth repreſent a Livery indeed, but I pray who gives this Livery? we can well diſtinguiſh between what comes through <hi>Rome,</hi> and that which is <hi>Romiſh.</hi> Why do you ſpeak ſo againſt that <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. ſince you wear her Livery?</p>
               <p>But to this <hi>indifferency,</hi> that the <hi>uſe</hi> of them is indifferent, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will not ſay; you declare your mind plain enough; <hi>They are indifferent, and ſo remain after they are commanded in their own nature, no neceſſity put upon them.</hi> To Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> and this Author.</p>
               <p>I pray tell us what Ceremony you can invent that is not indifferent in its <hi>own nature;</hi> tell us of one Ceremony that is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in its own nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Gods Ceremonies were indifferent in their own nature, not one neceſſary; let but God recall his <hi>Poſitive</hi> Law, I will put on all the High Prieſts garments, and make uſe of any Veſſels of the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pray, Sir, name that Ceremony which in its <hi>own nature</hi> is morally good or evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, as to their own nature are but indifferent, unleſs you will own <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law make them neceſſary, both <hi>neceſſitate praecepti, &amp; medii.</hi> When the Elements have ſerved their <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>end,</hi> the Sacrament's over, we eat and drink what remains, as other drink, &amp;c. you make yours a <hi>means</hi> to edification, as well as Chriſt doth his; and ſo much <hi>neceſſity</hi> of command lye upon them, that all the Miniſters (whom you call Knaves) that will not uſe them, be the Miniſters never ſo able and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they muſt be turned out of their Lords ſervice by your verdict, as they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. All the Popiſh Ceremonies are indifferent in their own nature, and may plead as much for the uſe of them all, as you do for yours. Yea, take their Pictures; being in a <hi>Papiſts</hi> houſe, I ſaw the Picture of a very Old man, I thought nothing of it, the Cloth, the Paint or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98093:38"/>Colours, the Effigies, the frame, were all indifferent in their nature; but when one told me that Picture was to repreſent the <hi>Ancient of Days,</hi> then I underſtood ſin enough in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> put no neceſſity upon their Ceremonies, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their Maſter <hi>Lombard,</hi> that tells you Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> Water appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Elementum &amp; Verbum,</hi> meeting together, make the Ordinance perfect without any Ceremony.</p>
               <p>But ſince they are thus <hi>indifferent,</hi> as you ſay, and Mr. <hi>Carre</hi> blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us for making a Schiſm, becauſe of theſe, which he terms thus, <hi>Trifles, poor needleſs things, ſuch as ſcarce come nigh to touch the fringe of Chriſts veſture.</hi> But to us they appear ſinful; and did we not ſo apprehend the things impoſed upon us, but that we might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing to God in our Conformity to them, we proteſt in his preſence who ſearcheth our hearts, and will judg both you and us, we would not ſtay one day from Conformity. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether you may better lay by theſe things, and not impoſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo indifferent, or may we better take them up, who at leaſt ſuſpect them to be ſinful, and cannot with a clear conſcience yield unto them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are <hi>we</hi> more guilty of <hi>ſchiſm</hi> that will not take up theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we apprehend them from the <hi>word</hi> to be <hi>ſinful,</hi> or <hi>you,</hi> that will not lay them down, but impoſe them, though you ſay they are <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent?</hi> I challenge Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> and all the Conformiſts to anſwer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p>If the things impoſed be but <hi>indifferent,</hi> as all the Conformiſts ſay, then Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> meets with an argument of the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> it is urged ſaith Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> p. 434. <hi>No ſuch indifferent things ought to be impoſed, but to be made the matter of mutual forbearance, according to the duty charged upon Chriſtians,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 Cor. 8.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> beſtows about 32 <hi>Pages</hi> to take off the Argument, and to give us the mind of thoſe Chapters.</p>
               <p>It is very true, Sir, the argument hath been uſed by the old <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> and in particular I knew it urged by one, and the 13th <hi>v.</hi> of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. preſſed hard upon the Prelate <hi>Laud</hi> in his Viſitation; to whom the Prelate gave this anſwer: <hi>True, when</hi> Paul <hi>was alone, and ſpake alone, thus he ſaid; but would</hi> Paul <hi>have ſaid ſo, if he had been in a Conſiſtory with the reſt of the Apoſtles?</hi> my friend made no reply, but held down his head, ſuppoſing thereby he might make the Prelate recall his words; this anſwer was becoming an Archbiſhop, and worthy of <hi>Laud!</hi> To be ſure he ſilenced my friend.</p>
               <p>Only this, Sir, let me ſay, they uſed the argument upon your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, <hi>that the things are indifferent;</hi> but though we grant the things conſidered abſolutely, or abſtractedly in their own nature are <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:98093:39"/>yet conſider them in their uſe, we look on them as <hi>ſinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To examine all that learned Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> hath written, would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and needleſs, for I ſhould yield to him in many things, had not the ſtate of the queſtion been miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Briefly therefore I will conſider the caſe the Apoſtle had before him, and apply our caſe to it.</p>
               <p>The Lord having in the old Law forbidden divers <hi>meats,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the obſervation of divers <hi>days,</hi> when Chriſt the ſubſtance, the body was come, theſe <hi>ſhadows</hi> vaniſhed. Some Believers in Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this; they knew, though once they were under a Law, yet at <hi>this time</hi> they were <hi>indifferent,</hi> and ſo they knew their liberty. Others, becauſe the Law was ſo expreſs, the obſervation had been many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, the words <hi>for ever</hi> added to thoſe Laws, they could not yet underſtand what the ſtronger Chriſtians did. The Apoſtle guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, chargeth theſe ſtronger Chriſtians not to judg, deſpiſe, refuſe, or offend theſe weaker Chriſtians; but to receive them into their hearts, into Church-fellowſhip, and all Church communion, and not perplex their minds with thoſe doubtful diſputations or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, but wait, and bear tenderly with them, till the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal that truth alſo unto them.</p>
               <p>For our caſe; the things in queſtion are no neceſſary circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, as <hi>time, place, &amp;c.</hi> which are neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Worſhip, and Antecedaneous to any act of mans <hi>will;</hi> but ſuch as have their dependance upon <hi>mans pleaſure only.</hi> Hence you tell us, you <hi>may change them when you pleaſe.</hi> Thoſe things fell under the command of God; and ſo not <hi>theſe,</hi> unleſs as forbidden by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of God, as thoſe <hi>meats</hi> were by particular Laws. For a <hi>man,</hi> a <hi>creature,</hi> to inſtitute a Doctrinal, Religious Ceremony, to teach men their duty they owe to God; ordain it as a mean to help, ſtir up their minds to their duty, and annex this to the worſhip of God; yea ſo as there muſt be no Divine Worſhip unleſs this Ceremony be uſed, it is ſuch high boldneſs, it doth ſo touch the Lords Prerogative, and tacite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo charge him with defect of wiſdom, as if he had not appointed means ſufficient to teach his Creature, but we muſt ſupply his defect <hi>by adding to his word;</hi> that let <hi>ſuperstition</hi> ſpeak never ſo ſmoothly, as it always comes with ſome <hi>pious end</hi> in the mouth, it is no other but wretched <hi>impiety,</hi> not will we by the help of his Grace conform unto it.</p>
               <p>You who tell us theſe things are <hi>indifferent,</hi> are yet ſo far from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Duty that Chriſt commands by the Apoſtle in theſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> us, <hi>not to judg us, not to offend us,</hi> that in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the command, you thruſt us out of the Lords work; you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98093:39"/>ſhut us out from the Sacraments; you excommunicate us, impriſon us, and do what in you lye to deſtroy us both ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>As to what you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 410. quoting Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> with whom you agree, <hi>It is not meant a bare diſpleaſing of our Brother, but doing ſuch actions which tend to occaſion ſome to fall from Chriſtianity, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Chriſtian Religion, for which you quote the</hi> 15. v. <hi>Deſtroy not him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part in ſome ſenſe I ſhould yield; but for the latter part which carries this ſenſe, that the <hi>deſtruction</hi> in the 15. <hi>v.</hi> was by making them to <hi>fall from Chriſtianity,</hi> as if there were no other way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them but that; I conceive humbly that your ſelf with Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> are both miſtaken.</p>
               <p>For that weak Chriſtian might be ſtrongly convinced that Chriſtian Religion was true, though he could not as yet ſee the repealing of thoſe Laws upon the reaſons I gave before; yet through the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pride, cruelty of the ſtronger Chriſtians who would judg, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him, and not receive him unleſs he would eat the <hi>forbidden meats,</hi> as they did; and through their example, whom he ſaw to eat, he might be put upon a temptation to eat ſuch meats too, not <hi>in faith,</hi> but with a <hi>doubtful conſcience,</hi> and ſo doing, he was <hi>condemned</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the laſt <hi>verſe.</hi> So their pride, unkindneſs, and example, did help to deſtroy their brother as much as in them lay.</p>
               <p>Hence in the firſt verſe of the Chapter, the Apoſtle charges them not to trouble ſuch a one with <hi>doubtful</hi> diſputations: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eo diſputis, de uſu li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis quam non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum poteſt intelligere, quod plus anxietatis &amp; kaeſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis, rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus animis parit, quàm utilitatis.</hi> Vatabl.</note> In the laſt verſe he ends with, <hi>He that doubteth,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is damned;</hi> ſo that he begins and ends with <hi>doubtfulneſs.</hi> Now had the weak Chriſtian fallen off from the Faith, the weak Chriſtian would not have eaten ſuch meats <hi>doubtfully,</hi> and ſo bring himſelf under the danger of condemnation for ſo doing; for to be ſure he would eat none of thoſe meats which made him fall off from Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw Chriſtians eat them, there was no danger of his damning for eating with a <hi>doubting conſcience;</hi> ſo that this implys, that he who eats with <hi>doubting,</hi> did yet hold his Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Thus have ſome by reaſon of that unkindneſs and ſeverity in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe Laws upon us, been put upon Subſcriptions with a doubtful Conſcience in their temptations, and afterwards have met with that which hath ſtung them. This is the <hi>charity</hi> of your Church towards your brethren.</p>
               <p>Nor doth that you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 435. help it, viz. <hi>That theſe different practiſes had a peculiar reſpect to thoſe times only, of the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtianity; for the Church afterwards in their Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all thoſe who obſerved thoſe Moſaical Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98093:40"/>
               <p>For we are under the ſame condition with thoſe Chriſtians who dare not eat the meat <hi>then,</hi> becauſe they had been forbidden in the Law; ſo, nor dare we ſubmit to your Humane Inventions in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, becauſe they are forbidden in the general Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not add,</hi> Deut. 12.32. <hi>They are not according to Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.8. Chriſt put no ſuch things into the Apoſtles Commiſſion to Preach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> So that with a <hi>doubtful conſcience</hi> at leaſt we muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them, and what is next, we know.</p>
               <p>Nor doth your obedience to authority help here, which ſo many are glad they have that ſtarting hole to run into, and your ſelf ſo much urge. Had theſe <hi>ſtrong</hi> brethren in this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. been Princes, or Archbiſhops, and they ſhould have commanded the weak brethren to have eat theſe <hi>meats,</hi> they had ſinned in their command; nor were they bound to obey them with a <hi>doubtful conſcience;</hi> to hazard amna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by obedience to ſuperiors, is no good Divinity. Yet, Sir, we do give obedience, and will preach up obedience to Princes, as much as any other, only in the matters of God, he is the ſuperior and ſupream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>Nemini fit injuria, cui praponitur Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your next Section, <hi>pag.</hi> 442. where you labour to defend your Ceremonies, though they have been abuſed in a corrupt way of worſhip in Popery. As for this Section Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> might have ſpared it; for Humane Doctrinal Ceremonies to be annexed to Gods own Inſtitutions, we judg them ſinful additions, intrenching upon the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and flighting of the wiſdom of Chriſt, though <hi>Rome</hi> had never known them; as if the wiſe holy God could not have appointed more Doctrinal Ceremonies, had he cared for them, as well as fooliſh ſinful man; but ſince then theſe were and are ſtill in the Popiſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and retained here when <hi>England</hi> threw off the Papal yoke, I will conſider what he hath ſaid, and but touch it briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Rome</hi> then, as now it ſtands, is that Whore deſcribed <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.1. this I doubt not; of this judgment were our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, the moſt learned of them; the Profeſſors of Divinity in both Univerſities, and generally of our pious and learned men in this Nation, before our troubles began; and alſo of foreign Divines. Was it ever known that a chaſt Virgin, as the Church ſhould be to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. would dreſs up her ſelf with the reliques of a known Whore? <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> Apoc. 18.4. this is not obedience to that call.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It ſeems very ſtrange that when Gods own Inſtitution came to be abuſed to Idolatry, as the Brazen Serpent, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. that muſt now be broken in pieces; and muſt a Humane Inſtitution uſed in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious worſhip, in an Idolatrous Church, be yet retained in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church?</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98093:40"/>
               <p>I ſhall not write out his Argument at length.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>In Regeneration the bodies and ſouls once abuſed to the ſervice of the Devil, Luſt, Idols, may yet find acceptance with God, in ſerving of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A ſtrange argument for a learned man! If ſo excellent a Creature as man, made after the Image of God, under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of obedience to his Creator, being fallen from God, but by Gods rich mercy, the Obedience, Blood, and Sacrifice of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt, be accepted of God; Then a paultry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ceremony <hi>indifferent</hi> in its own nature, and no <hi>neceſſity</hi> for the uſe, if abuſed in an Idolatrous Church, may yet be retained in a chaſt Church, and the uſe of it acceptable to God. This Logick I underſtand not: Conſequence denied. I could enlarge my anſwer, but will not.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. <hi>Arg. From ſingle merſion, and threefold merſion in baptizm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Was the <hi>water, ſo baptizing in water,</hi> a Human Ceremony and Invention, or Chriſts own Inſtitution? For dipping in the water, or pouring of the water upon the perſon, your Church allow both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie both. If any did dip thrice, denying the Trinity of perſons to be of the ſame eſſence, that was their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but if any did hold the Trinity of perſons in the Unity of the eſſence, and yet would dip thrice, though I do not much like it, yet I ſhould not condemn them of Hereſie, the Text mentions nothing, whether once, or thrice. But prove <hi>Baptizing in water</hi> to be mans invention.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>The Chriſtians lawfully uſed thoſe fountains where the Gentiles drew water for their Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> And why not? did the Heathen and <hi>Julian</hi> make thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or God make them for the uſe of Man and Beaſt? ſhall therefore an Idolater deprive the Chriſtians of thoſe which God made for the uſe and neceſſity of Man and Beaſt, <hi>What is ſold in the ſhambles?</hi> 1 Cor. 12.25. But this you are to prove, if you will make an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, that when the Idolaters had taken water out of thoſe Fountains, carried it to their Idol Temples, made uſe of it in their Idol worſhip, that then the Chriſtians would take <hi>that</hi> water, and baptize believers in it; though yet there is more to be ſaid for them, than for your Ceremonies, becauſe to <hi>baptize in water,</hi> was Chriſts Inſtitution. For the fountains, <hi>Julian</hi> might have Dedicated the Land thereabouts to Idols, and Devils, as well as the Fountains, and ſo the Chriſtians ſhould be afraid to ſow Corn to maintain Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>We meet in their Churches or places they built, uſe their Bells, Tenths, for maintenance of Miniſters.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98093:41"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. For places. 1ſt. <hi>Place</hi> hath no moral ſignification, as your Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. 2. Place is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſo not your Ceremonies. 3. Thoſe places were built for the worſhip of the true God and Chriſt; though theſe blind Idolaters might alſo intend ſome Saint: But if they had been built <hi>only</hi> for the worſhip of a Saint, in imitation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>Demons,</hi> we would not meet in them, but done by them as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did by the Idols Temples, razed ſome to the ground, and ſhut up others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Bells.</hi> It ſeems you uſe them all the while you are reading Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and worſhipping God in your Surplice, the Bells are Chiming: I thought the Bells had done when worſhip began.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something muſt be done to give notice to the people what time the worſhip of God begins; ſo the Bell doth this day; to morrow it calls the people to a meeting about Town-affairs</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bells have no moral ſignification in them, as your Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I believe few Bells in <hi>England,</hi> but have been caſt ſince the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Popery, to make them muſical; and none uſe them for that end. No ſuch muſical tunes did I obſerve in <hi>Spain,</hi> but a confuſed jangling in time of Thunder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Tenths,</hi> Miniſters maintenance, have no moral ſignification, nor annexed to Divine Worſhip. The people tell you, <hi>Tenths</hi> are <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> not <hi>Popiſh.</hi> Though, by their ſavour, twice we read of Tenths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid to God before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law. But for maintenance, poor <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are not concern'd in this argument.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>The Heathens lifted up their eyes when they worſhipped their Idols, their gods, Sun, Moon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Did the Heathen call a Convention, and there decree, That when men did worſhip God, they ſhould lift up their eyes to heaven as your Convocation appointed theſe? or did <hi>Natures light</hi> teach them this geſture?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were the Heathens the <hi>firſt</hi> that in worſhipping of Idols lifted up their eyes to heaven? Did not <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> and the Saints before the Flood; and <hi>Noah, Sem,</hi> &amp;c. after it, lift up their eyes in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God? If the Heathen will imitate the Church, muſt the Church lay by duty? becauſe the Heathen worſhip Devils, therefore we muſt not worſhip God?</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>I dolatrous ſacrifices were practiſed before the giving of the Law, yet God continued and commanded ſaerifices after the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Your Argument ſpeaks thus much: If the Devil will be Gods Ape, and hateful enemy, then God muſt have no worſhip; and every time the Devil imitates Gods worſhip, God muſt change his worſhip, and appoint <hi>new</hi> means of worſhip.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:98093:41"/>
               <p>I pray Sir, did the Devil, or God firſt appoint <hi>Sacrifices?</hi> why may I not think the Devil underſtood ſomething of the promiſed ſeed, and the meaning of the Sacrifices; and in the following Ages, in hatred and revenge againſt God, and hatred of ſouls, drew men to ſacrifice to himſelf, not only beaſts, but <hi>men,</hi> as being the beſt of Creatures, and ſo moſt acceptable Sacrifice, in the imitation of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that ſhould have been ſacrificed? and thus he got before God.</p>
               <p>Sir, I pray do this: ſhew us where there were Ceremonies firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Idolators, depending only on their <hi>wills</hi> (as yours do, and you tell us you may change them when you pleaſe) theſe were uſed in idalatrous worſhip, and the Church of God tranſlated thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (I do not mean individual) from the idolatrous Temples into the worſhip of the holy and true God, and he approved of them. This you muſt prove, or elſe you ſpeak not home to our Caſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> brings, is the Teſtimony of worthy men about retaining <hi>ſome Ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c. I only ſay, I honour the men; but I am of Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi>'s opinion, that the holy Scriptures are the only unerring <hi>Rule,</hi> and I will willingly follow them; ſo men, where they follow Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Several Diſtinctions about ſignificant ſigns, Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> makes; but I ſee not how any of them reach the Queſtion, no not ſo much as one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here are ſigns depending only on the <hi>Wills</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe ſigns are Inſtituted to Inſtruct us in our Duty towards God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe are ſaid to be helps for our Edification.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe ſigns are appropriated and annexed to the Worſhip of God. While we Adminiſter <hi>his ſigns,</hi> we ſet up <hi>our ſigns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He that uſeth not theſe ſigns, is turned out of the work of the Lord, and ſhall not worſhip the Lord.</p>
               <p>I deſire Mr. <hi>Falk</hi> would either from expreſs Scripture, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence from Scripture, or from the example of any holy and ordinary perſons in Scripture approved by God; I ſay, I deſire from either of theſe he would prove ſuch ſigns in this manner Impoſed. Did <hi>Moſes</hi> ever dare to Inſtitute one <hi>Exciting</hi> (which is one Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) ſign, and annex it to the worſhip of God, more than he had in charge from God? yea and turn out thoſe Prieſts that would not uſe it?</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of your Ceremonies, <hi>they are not Dark and Dumb, but ſo ſet forth, that every man may underſtand what they mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May <hi>every</hi> man underſtand, &amp;c? truly I have known the Surplice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fifty years, but never underſtood that the putting on a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98093:42"/>ſhould properly ſignifie the <hi>Reverence</hi> we bear to God, and the <hi>high eſteem of his ordinances,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Falk.</hi> told me ſo, p. 391. nor I believe did few Preiſts ſo underſtand it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems then when you put <hi>off</hi> the Surplice, going into Pulpit, now you declare a lower eſteem of God and his Ordinances</p>
               <p>Others tell us, it ſignifies <hi>Purity;</hi> others <hi>Decency;</hi> it ſeems you are not agreed in the ends of your own inventions.</p>
               <p>But for your <hi>exciting</hi> ſign in the <hi>Croſs;</hi> many thouſands, if not millions of Children in <hi>England</hi> have been baptized with this ſign. I pray Name but <hi>One</hi> of theſe that ever was <hi>Excited</hi> to fight under Chriſts Banner, by this ſign. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a word in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming party glory much; all Learning and Reaſon they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed. I pray, Sir, ſhew us the Reaſon, how the moving of a Prieſts finger over an Infants Fore-head, in its Baptiſm, comes to have that efficacy to <hi>excite</hi> that Infant to fight under Chriſts Banner? How the Chriſtians of old uſed the <hi>real</hi> ſign of the Croſs, I know (I do not go about to juſtifie or condemn their practiſe) but this is another thing, or ſhadow of a thing; no wonder though your own Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> calls your Ceremonies <hi>trifles,</hi> things of which come no good. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir, while you ſpeak of the <hi>Reverence</hi> of God, we ſhould ſhow more Reverence to that Majeſty, in being content with his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wiſdom in his own Inſtitutions, and not annex vain empty trifles to them, and turn out thoſe men who will not ſubmit unto them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THE next thing required of us, is our ſubjection to the <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Government,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>ſix</hi> diſtinct Officers (or more) that exerciſe Church-power; and holy Writ knows but <hi>one</hi> of them: In the Commonwealth none dare pretend to Office but only ſuch as the King and the Law authorize and appoint; if there ſhould be any other, their power and actions were null, invalid, and they liable to puniſhment. But in the Church men can be more bold. Here Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s notion, if true, muſt help us, <hi>viz. That Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or determined no</hi> form <hi>of Government in the Church, but left it to the chief Magiſtrates, or Church-governours to appoint the form,</hi> &amp;c. the deſign of his <hi>Irenicon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that Iearned Piece there are ſeveral things I muſt yield to, as, <hi>That the power of Ordination is proper to the name</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>p.</hi> 285. To which let me add what Mr. <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> a Miniſter dead above 20 years ſince, told us, he with many others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98093:42"/>at one time Ordained by the Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> the Biſhop bad them all take notice, <hi>That he did not Ordain as Biſhop, but as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter;</hi> this Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would take his Oath to be true; yet Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> told me, <hi>The power of Ordination was ſolely in the Biſhop, and though Presbyters did impoſe hands with the Biſhop, it was out of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> Thank you, Sir! I am not to meddle with this now. I preſume he would defend this as well as he did the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, in the ſeveral ſheets that paſſed betwixt us upon the queſtion; but whence then comes <hi>Reordination</hi> to the ſame office in the ſame Church? a thing unknown to <hi>Fathers, Councils, Papiſts, Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> but only to this new Edition of Conformiſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. I ſhall yield alſo to him in this, <hi>That it is not neceſſary there ſhould be ſo many particular Churches as particular Congregations.</hi> And this is a queſtion of great moment. Of this a word hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. I agree alſo with him, <hi>That the power of Order and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is committed by Chriſt</hi> ex aequo, <hi>to all Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> actu primo, <hi>or habitually,</hi> p. 197, 198, 275.</p>
               <p>By this we may underſtand what he means by <hi>Church Governours</hi> in the Queſtion. To which I ſhall ſpeak but briefly, though I had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a larger diſcourſe upon it. Three things then I would prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt hath appointed a <hi>Form</hi> of Government in his Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. I will ſhew what that form is, and this will prove the firſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That form is <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Conſequently if this Eccleſiaſtical Government which we are required to ſubject to, be not according to that Form, then I hope they will not blame us though we refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto it, as we would refuſe ſubjection to one in the Commonwealth, who is not an Officer according to Law.</p>
               <p>Profeſſing withal for my ſelf, and I dare ſay for all the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that if it can be made good that Chriſt hath appointed ſuch a Government in his Church, we will moſt willingly ſubject unto it, being glad we are eaſed of ſuch a burden. Pride ſhall never hinder us, though that be ſo much charged upon us.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> meets with ſeveral arguments that ſome have produced to prove there <hi>muſt be a Form appointed,</hi> and he anſwers them; but his anſwers do not ſatisfie. I had prepared a reply to his anſwers, but lay it by.</p>
               <p>To their Arguments I would add one or two more.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if Chriſt hath determined no form of Government in his Church, then the Form may be <hi>Monarchical;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove it for the prevention of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> will carry it; <hi>a ſimili,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp;c. de Rom. Pontif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> might have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98093:43"/>ſpared the <hi>ſeventh Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Rational Account,</hi> wherein he labours to diſprove the Jeſuit, arguing for the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Form.</p>
               <p>Kings are ſupream in all caſes Eccleſiaſtical, ſays the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> the ſupream Magiſtrate may determine the Form, ſays Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> then the <hi>Ten Kings may give their power to the Beaſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Paſtor and a Deacon may ſerve at firſt, while believers are few; but when the Church is enlarged to a whole Nation, there muſt be another Form of Government,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 180. <hi>Irenic.</hi> Go on, Sir; when the Church is enlarged to many Nations, there may be another Form; and why not then <hi>Monarchical?</hi> Chriſt having determined none, as the Doctor ſaith.</p>
               <p>Above one thouſand Presbyters in a Dioceſs may devolve the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that power which Chriſt hath committed to them <hi>actu primo</hi> to one perſon, according to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> ſo may ten thouſand as well, for ought I know, to one Biſhop, and he may exerciſe it by his Arch-deacon, Chancellor, Commiſſaries, as well as now.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If God determine a Form of Government in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, then Chriſt in the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> Chriſts Kingly-Government in the heart, is ſecret, none can <hi>ſee</hi> that; his viſible Government by which he is made known to the world, is known by his Ordinances, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Houſe, (as our Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Seſſions, and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, ſhew our Kings Government) with the Profeſſion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and converſation of Chriſtians accordingly. He is <hi>faithful in his houſe, Heb.</hi> 3.6. that <hi>Houſe</hi> is his Church, which he builds, not the Commonwealth; <hi>qua ſic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. To determine a Form of Government, argues more <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> more <hi>Perfection,</hi> more <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the ſupream Governour, than to appoint only an unformed Government; as it were a meer <hi>materiae prima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Prince give a Charter to a Corporation, a Patent to a Colony, he appoints the form of their Government. He that gives the <hi>form</hi> in other things, gives the <hi>perfection</hi> of the thing. Chriſts Form in the Church carries authority, and hath an awe upon the hearts of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; this notion brings Chriſt in his wiſdom and Soveraignty below an earthly Prince.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath affirmed Chriſt hath appointed a <hi>form</hi> of Government in his Church; for whereas the Jeſuit is pleading for the <hi>Monarchical form</hi> of the Church-Government, becauſe wiſe men have thought that to be beſt; the Doctor anſwers, <hi>What is this to the proving what Government Chriſt hath appointed in his Church? for that is the beſt Government of the Church, not which Philoſophers and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have thought beſt, but which our Saviour hath appointed in his word.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98093:43"/>Ration. Account,</hi> p. 464. then Chriſt hath appointed a form in his word, (and I hope that is <hi>Jure Divino</hi>) elſe the Jeſuit is not anſwered. We need no more proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſecond Queſt. <hi>What then is that form? A.</hi> I ſhall lay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Propoſitions, and clear them by Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt Prop. <hi>In all Churches in the New Teſtament, where we read of Elders, we read of ſeveral Elders in one Church; we never read but of one Elder in a Church,</hi> that I call to mind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem; one</hi> Church, but divers Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6, 23, <hi>v. &amp;</hi> 16. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. In the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> one Church, but ſeveral Elders, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. In the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> one Church, but more Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there were divers Elders, witneſs the <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. In the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> divers Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. In the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> were ſeveral Elders, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. So <hi>Polycarpus</hi>'s Epiſtle to the Church declares.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. In the Church of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſeveral Elders, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.17. <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and <hi>Archippus,</hi> we are ſure of; the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſay <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> alſo, from <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.9.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. In the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were ſeveral Elders, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. Let any man that oppoſes me produce one Church where there was but <hi>one</hi> ſingle Paſtor; though if it were ſo, it will not ſave us; for the Churches then had the Apoſtles living among them, and could help that ſingle Paſtor, if the Church were but new planted.</p>
               <p n="9">9ly. In <hi>Act</hi> 14.24. <hi>The Apoſtles ordained them Elders</hi> (not an Elder) <hi>in every Church.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> one of your own, joining this Text with <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. croſſes Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s gloſs on the Text, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>no Church wanted an Elder, not that every Church had more Elders;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> thus, <hi>not meaning one Elder in a place, but Presbyteries, Colledg of Presbyters, with common advice to order the Churches planted in thoſe cities.</hi> This agrees with the plain Gramar of the Text; 2. with eight examples I gave before; 3ly. The <hi>Syriack</hi> is full for our ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> while he labours to darken this Text, forgets himſelf ſtrangely; for <hi>p.</hi> 239. He lays this for <hi>a foundation to clear the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical practiſe</hi> viz. <hi>that the Apoſtles in framing Churches did obſerve the cuſtoms of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Synagogues.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 248. <hi>Having cleared that there was a peculiar form of Government in the Synagogues, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles copied out the Government of the Chriſtian Churches by them.</hi> Now

                  <hi>p.</hi> 429. <hi>he tells us there were divers Rulers in a Synagogue, is evident from</hi> Act. 13.15. he ſuppoſes, <hi>Ten wiſe men did jointly concur for ruling the affairs of the Synagogue.</hi> p. 250. <hi>ſo many Elders to make a Bench.</hi> Strange the Doctor ſhould forget his <hi>foundation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> darken that Text. I might have ſhown how croſs Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> are one to another. Forſooth the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> (not only the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi>) were ſent for according to <hi>Hammond. Grotius</hi> is clear againſt <hi>Hammond, de Imper.</hi> p. 343, 393.</p>
               <p>But I ſhould anſwer thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how many miles <hi>Philippi</hi> was diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the way <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to <hi>Bunting,</hi> who gives an account of all the miles from Port to Port that <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed, it was two thouſand one hundred and fifty ſix miles, if he miſtake not.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Conſider how many days between the Feaſt of Unleavened bread, and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> to ſail theſe miles.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. What time <hi>Paul</hi> ſet ſail from <hi>Philippi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. How many days he ſtayed in ſeveral places, all which I had caſt up.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. When he came at <hi>Miletum,</hi> thirty days at leaſt were ſpent, he had but twenty days; of theſe he ſtays eight days by the way; beſides two days journey going and coming between <hi>Miletum</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as they reckon it; from <hi>Miletum</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 844 miles, according to <hi>Bunting;</hi> he ſtays at <hi>Philips</hi> houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.8, 10. At <hi>Miletum,</hi> Act. 20.16. <hi>He haſted if poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. yet now he ſends for the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia;</hi> this is the fancy of that learned man.</p>

When <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.15. ſaith, <hi>O ye Philippians;</hi> he means the ſame perſons in <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.4. but if one in <hi>France</hi> ſhould write to the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> would they write, <hi>O ye Londoners,</hi> they are but ſtrangers, as the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Philippi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> there were Elders, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. but none <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtian Biſhops, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Theſe turned from Idols, &amp;c.</hi> not ſo the <hi>Jews.</hi> So in <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſeveral Elders, but no <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſtinct Elders, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. make that clear.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:98093:44"/>
               <p>I could give more anſwers.—</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>The Elders in the Goſpel-churches had all of them Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power committed to them alike.</hi> I mean the <hi>ordinary teaching Elders.</hi> So Biſhop <hi>Jewel, If it be a hereſie to ſay that by the Scriptures of God, a Biſhop and Prieſt are all one, then many of the Fathers</hi> (whom he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>yea Paul himſelf muſt be a Heretick.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath yielded this, and we deſire no more; the truth is the ſame if he be changed; this queſtion Learned Pens have diſcuſſed, I let it alone.</p>
               <p>Prop. 3. <hi>This equality of power which the Elders received from Chriſt did continue all the time the Apoſtles lived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I think Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> yields, <hi>p.</hi> 275. the Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> after the Apoſtles time, and of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> declare the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Teachers, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. did <hi>Ordain;</hi> ſo ſeveral of the ancient and modern Divines, <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſo underſtand it; there is a full definition of Ordination. If this were <hi>Peter</hi>'s, ſee where is that Biſhop, had there been an Apoſtle, he had been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ought to have Excommunicated the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, though <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſent to them, or here joined with them. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> on the Text ſpeaks fully to the point.</p>
               <p>Prop. 4. <hi>The number of the Elders increaſing in the Church by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the increaſe of the Believers; One of theſe Elders, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that Elder which was firſt Ordained by the Apoſtles in the Church, had a Primacy, as to order and honour, but not as to power and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over his fellow Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text commands it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>ult. Order</hi> muſt be, and where there is a Plurality, to avoid confuſion there muſt be <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be Twenty Juſtices of the Peace in a County, and the King add Ten more, it doth not alter the form of Government: At the Seſſions <hi>one</hi> muſt be for <hi>order</hi> ſake the Judg of the Seſſions, and the other Juſtices do not devolve the exerciſe of their power upon him, nor hath he more power than the reſt, every one exerts his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So in the Parliament, a <hi>Speaker</hi> muſt be, but no ſuperiority of power, nor devolving the exerciſe of the power of the other Members upon him: ſo it is in the Church.</p>
               <p>That Eminent Servant of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> alloweth of an <hi>Epiſcopus Humanus</hi> in the Conſociation of Churches, to moderate the actions of the Aſſembly, to propound things to be agitated, to gather voices, to pronounce the Sentence which paſſed by common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Reaſon and order ſaith he, forceth ſuch a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, <hi>Survey Chu. Diſc. p.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 22, 23. only the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it he denies from experience. There is the pinch.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98093:45"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. <hi>This Primacy</hi> (I humbly conceive) <hi>did continue in that Elder, during his life,</hi> (unleſs for ſome default he were caſt out by his fellow Elders) I ſhall wrangle with none of my brethren, nor differ from them in affection about it, but I ſhall ground my notion on the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The word doth not connote any ſuperiority of power over the reſt, no more than when the King wrote from <hi>Breda,</hi> or at any other time to the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the Houſe of Lords, or Commons, or to the Judg of the Seſſions, did or do argue any ſuperiority of power, but only order; what <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith of the word <hi>Angelus, Angelorum vox eſt nomen Officii, ne naturae,—cum mittuntur vocantur Angeli.</hi> So here, <hi>all Elders are ſent, Rom.</hi> 10.15. if <hi>ſent,</hi> then they are Angels. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of power among the ordinary teaching Elders, was the firſt ſtep Antichriſt took to get into his Chair.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The word is to be taken <hi>individually,</hi> not <hi>collectively.</hi> So fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Reynolds</hi> againſt <hi>Hart, p.</hi> 314. So <hi>Beza, Piſcator, Paraeus,</hi> and many others. The inſtances our brethren give to prove <hi>collectively,</hi> ſome do not prove it; others, as the <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Goat</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>Revel.</hi> I humbly conceive give away the Cauſe, (for there was ever <hi>one ſuperiour in power),</hi> which I will not yield.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That this perſon was <hi>during life,</hi> &amp;c. The Argument brought againſt it is no Scripture, but <hi>humane Prudence from experience:</hi> ſo Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> To which I ſay, keep out but ſuperiority of power, and the danger is avoided: and no doubt while the Churches kept that out, this form of government carried on things very well. You cannot then charge me with being croſs to Scripture in my opinion.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Since you cannot prove me ſo, then I prove my ſenſe from the practice of the primitive Churches, of which we have the Hiſtories, which to me is of great force in proving the ſenſe of a Text, that ſeems very fair, and have no other Scripture to contradict that ſenſe: how much the Hiſtories of them ſpeak of a ſingle perſon, who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? and that <hi>during life. Ambroſe</hi> (or whoever it was, as ancient as he) in his Comment on the 4 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> ſpeaks home to the point, ſee <hi>Theſ. Salmar. p.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 299.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. By the Seven Epiſtles to the Churches, I find him in his Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, do you prove it was but for one or two Seſſions, not during his life. Certainly that Angel was well known in the Church to whom Chriſt wrote: in ſome Churches commending him, in others diſcommending; though its true, the Epiſtles concerned the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. This <hi>Angel</hi> is not the Moderator in a <hi>conſociation of Churches,</hi> as Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeaks of, whoſe conſtancy in the place may
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98093:45"/>be bad, but the Primate among the Elders of <hi>one</hi> particular Church: ſo that his fear does not reach us.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. For the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of this.</p>
               <p>This form Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> cannot deny the Apoſtles did conſtitute in the Churches; but it ſeems the Apoſtolical practice, though they were guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, is not ſufficient to make a <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum,</hi> a <hi>poſitive Law;</hi> for it is demanded.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. There was no <hi>poſitive Law</hi> for the change of the ſeventh-day Sabbath; but yet the Dr. tells us, the Apoſtolical practice is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for they were guided by an Infallible Spirit, <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. If ſo, in a matter of far greater moment than in this, I hope, it is ſufficient, the Dr. cannot deny it.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> denies the 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15, 16. proves <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> Then what <hi>poſitive Law</hi> hath he for <hi>Excommunications, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Ordination</hi> of Church-Officers?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The <hi>Apoſtolical form</hi> did beſt conduce to the <hi>end</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Dr. urges much againſt the Jeſuit, <hi>Rat. Account, p.</hi> 462.</p>
               <p>I pray compare that form then, and our form now; under which did, or do <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>prophaneneſs</hi> moſt abound?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. If not ſo, then one great end of the Acts of the Apoſtles, which <hi>Oecumenius</hi> calls the <hi>Evangelium Spiritus ſancti</hi>) is loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Lapide</hi> in his Preface to that Book ſpeaks excellently.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. I ſet up <hi>this Form;</hi> you demand my authority; I anſwer, It was the Form they ſet up who were guided by an Infallible Spirit, and Chriſt owned the Form in writing to it. You ſet up your Form dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from it; I demand of you, ſhew me your authority, and ſee which is beſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. If Apoſtolical practiſe be not ſufficient, then you may to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Form, for ought I know, I know no ſtop.</p>
               <p>As to the Author of the Book <hi>Samaritaniſm,</hi> I am ſure the Author was nothing a-kin to the good <hi>Samaritan;</hi> for he ſhews himſelf a man of a vinegar-ſpirit, his diſcourſe as to Church-Government, is built upon this foundation, <hi>That Form of Government which appeared for hundreds of years, firſt, only, and was</hi> de facto <hi>Inſtituted of God, that only hath Divine right to warrant it,</hi> p. 10, 11. In p. 37. I find this was <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> but this is very falſe; theſe three terms, <hi>firſt, only, and hundreds of years,</hi> are not found in <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours had power over Biſhops and Archbiſhops, if any ſuch Creatures were.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. They were not the <hi>only</hi> Governours, for the Presbyters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned while the Apoſtles lived.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98093:46"/>
               <p n="3">3ly. The <hi>firſt</hi> Governours did not laſt <hi>hundreds of years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. The <hi>firſt</hi> Government was not confined to a narrow Dioceſs, as <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was. In <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time there were in one Province under <hi>Carthage</hi> of the Catholicks and Donatiſts above nine hundred Biſhops, but their <hi>firſt</hi> Governours had all Nations for their Dioceſs, and that made their Government <hi>Apostolical.</hi> I am ſure there is none ſuch now.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Presbyters</hi> were <hi>firſt</hi> before <hi>Biſhops;</hi> witneſs your own Tribe, that tell the world, Epiſcopacy was ſet up to prevent <hi>Schiſm</hi> among Presbyters after the Schiſm in <hi>Corinth</hi> among the Presbyters.</p>
               <p>According to this Author, there is no Government at all in the Church; for theſe three <hi>Terms</hi> are found in no form of Government now; therefore I leave him.</p>
               <p>As for his fine language wherewith he courts us, as <hi>Jack-ſtraws, Fools, Knaves, Peeviſh, &amp;c.</hi> this <hi>Samaritans</hi> Oil and Wine, we bear it, <hi>the Diſciple is not above his Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Queſtion of very great conſequence, but for theſe times not ſo uſeful, therefore I will only ſtate it, and give mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about it, and leave it, though I had prepared ſomething to ſpeak to it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whether every particular Congregation conſiſting of one teaching Elder, and a number of viſible Chriſtians, be a particular Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the New Teſtament? or may not, yea, ought not ſeveral particular Congregations unite, to make up one particular Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a Church I mean an <hi>Organical</hi> Church, inveſted with all the power and exerciſe of the Keys within it ſelf, both <hi>quo ad actum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum &amp; ſecundum;</hi> ſuch were the eight Churches I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Learned and pious <hi>Ames, Med. Theol. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 39. tells us, <hi>That a Church in the New Teſtament is a Parochial Church; ſuch a company or congregation as ordinarily meet in one place to worſhip God.</hi> (Sure I am that ordinarily there is but one teaching-Elder in ſuch a Church.) <hi>And this Church hath as much power as the National Church of the Jews met together.</hi> Compare his 16 <hi>&amp;</hi> 18 <hi>Theſes;</hi> great uſe he makes of the words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. ſo doth a reverend Brother, who knew my opinion, quote it with a little warmth; but my good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt prove there was but one Teaching-Elder in that Church, elſe his argument will be guilty of <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi;</hi> five anſwers more I would have given.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker</hi> giving the true ſenſe of <hi>Independency,</hi> ſaith, it <hi>imports thus much, Every particular congregation, rightly constituted,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98093:46"/>and compleated, hath ſufficiency in it ſelf to exerciſe all the Ordinances of Christ.</hi> Surv. Ch. Diſ. part 2. pag. 80. But then it ſeems it muſt be <hi>compleated;</hi> and to this compleating are required a Paſtor, Teacher, Ruling-Elder, Deacon, one at leaſt of all theſe. So <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>ib.</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, though a particular Congregation may be called a true Church, as a man that hath but one eye, one arm or leg, may be ſtill defined <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> as having a reaſonable ſoul; yet he is but maimed, no intire man; ſuch is that Church, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>Ibid.</hi> I pray how many ſuch Congregations have we?</p>
               <p>The Synod held at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> Septemb. 10. 1679, the laſt year, <hi>pag.</hi> 10, 11. calling for a full ſupply of Officers in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſpeak thus: <q rend="inline">The defect of the Churches on this account is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lamentable, there being in moſt of the Churches only one Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officer, for the burden of the whole Congregation to lye upon. The Lord Chriſt would not have inſtituted Paſtors, Teachers, Ruling Elders (nor the Apoſtles have ordained Elders in every Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.) if he had not ſeen there was need of them for the good of his people; and therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is both to break the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and to reflect upon the wiſdom of Chriſt, as if he did appoint unneceſſary Officers in his Church.</q> Thus the Synod.</p>
               <p>Half the queſtion then is gained, the <hi>Independents</hi> yield it, men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be liſtned to, for they take up the word of God for their <hi>only</hi> Rule. I know there is a great queſtion about the Ruling Elder, but I am not to meddle with it now.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgment, I ſuppoſe, yield the queſtion, <hi>they may and ought</hi> to unite, to make up one <hi>Governing Church;</hi> but I do not fully underſtand their meaning. Suppoſe twenty Pariſhes and Congregations that meet together to worſhip God, and twenty Miniſters belonging to them, are theſe twenty Pariſhes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Churches as to Word and Sacraments, ſo that he that is Paſtor in one Church, hath nothing to do in another Pariſh, as to feeding them with <hi>Word and Sacraments,</hi> but as to Government and Juriſdiction one Miniſter with the reſt of the Claſſis have power over them all? if this be the meaning, I am not ſatisfied in it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> hath declared his judgment, they <hi>may unite.</hi> I wiſh he had pleaſed to have opened his mind fully about it.</p>
               <p>If he will yield but this, <hi>That constitution of a Church wherein a Pastor cannot poſſibly feed with Word and Sacraments, watch over and govern his flock according to Christ, be it Dioceſan or Parochial, that constitution is not according to Christ, and conſequently unlawful, (as Scripture-light, and nature's light will prove it)</hi> I ſhould, it may be, come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98093:47"/>up to him, to perform our duty by <hi>Substitutes;</hi> this may pleaſe them who make their <hi>own brains,</hi> not <hi>Gods word,</hi> their rule, and ſuch we little regard.</p>
               <p>God hath now brought me to old age in my Pilgrimage; divers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about Church-work and Government I have read; abſurd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural practices in Churches I have <hi>ſeen;</hi> woful diſorders and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched effects I have <hi>heard and known;</hi> great ſcandal, but ſo circumſtanced, that a ſingle Paſtor could not proceed by <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to remove it; I have <hi>met</hi> with one of the ableſt Divines in <hi>England,</hi> and exerciſed in Government, was of the ſame opinion with me, all ariſing from this notion of a ſingle Paſtor with ſuch a people making a Church; and all which miſchiefs might be avoided, if the uniting of ſeveral particular Congregations into one particular Church were admitted, which Scripture-examples, and Scripture-reaſons will ſufficiently juſtifie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of SCHISM.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere remains yet one thing to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> the great crime of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> with which we are charged by the <hi>Fr. Deb.</hi> in his firſt and ſecond Book very deeply; thus alſo Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> and this is the common language of them all, both in Pulpit and Preſs.</p>
               <p>To which I would take liberty to ſpeak more largely: That <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church is a great crime, is readily yielded by underſtanding men of all parties, and no party will own it, though they be guilty enough of it.</p>
               <p>At this day all but Conformiſts are Schiſmaticks; but to the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical party this ſin is a ſtranger; yea in the time of our troubles, when they were in <hi>France,</hi> and refuſed Communion with the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, yet a Prelatical perſon was not then, nor can be guilty of Schiſm, but they were Schiſmaticks in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is <hi>Schiſm?</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 112, 113. <hi>Schiſm is a voluntary ſeparation of ones ſelf without cauſe given, from that Chriſtian Church whereof once he was a member.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He opens his Definition, <hi>p.</hi> 113, 114.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a ſeparation, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. <q rend="inline">When a man ſhall refuſe to join
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98093:47"/> in the acts and exerciſes of Religion, uſed by ſuch a ſociety, and to ſubmit to its authority. So he that refuſeth Baptiſm, the Lords-Supper, or to ſubmit to the cenſures of the Church.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus he.</hi> But what he means by <hi>non-ſubmiſſion to the cenſures of the Church,</hi> I know not, for I know but few <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that are under the Cenſures of <hi>their</hi> Church: nor how it will agree with his ſecond: which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It muſt be <hi>voluntary ſeparation:</hi> So that Excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are no Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>It is ſeparation from a particular Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>Of which Church he was once a member, becauſe Schiſm imports diviſion, making two of that which was but one before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But according to this opening of his definition, I pray Sir, tell us how you will prove us <hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For take up your third head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I pray tell us what is that <hi>particular</hi> Church you mean, <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Dioceſan, Parochial?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>National,</hi> I know not how you underſtand a <hi>National</hi> Church; for as I underſtand it, you cannot prove us Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> you cannot prove us Schiſmaticks, unleſs the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſubmit to <hi>Prelatical Government</hi> be Schiſm. (For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belong not to a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church <hi>quâ ſic.</hi>) I ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s judgment to be the ſame with the Doctor that kept the Act at the Commencement at <hi>Cambridg.</hi> I heard ſo much of one queſtion, that I laboured much to get a view of it, but could not in our parts. A Conformiſt told me it was to this purpoſe, <hi>Receſſio a regimine Epiſcopali, eſt mortale ſchiſma;</hi> he told me, <hi>Damnabile ſchiſma,</hi> as it was told him.</p>
               <p>I ſay only this to it: As God gives up ſome men to monſtrous luſts in practiſe, ſo he doth others to as monſtrous opinions in judgment in theſe days. So that it muſt be meant the <hi>Parochial</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But, 2ly. I pray prove that we were members once of that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Church you mean. For the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> we deny any ſuch Church (eſpecially as your conſtitution is) to be according to Chriſts Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore were not, are not members of it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches, I pray how are we members of them?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not by our <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> if that were your meaning, I would ſoon give arguments to confute it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not by my dwelling within ſuch a Pariſh-bounds; though I am for the <hi>Vicinity</hi> of Church-members, yet I was not ſo ſimple when I was in my Place, to think that all the people that dwelt within the bounds of the Pariſh where I was Miniſter, muſt own me for their Miniſter; as if a ſpot of ground meaſured out by a Civil conſtitution,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98093:48"/>muſt make a man a member of a Church, which <hi>as ſuch</hi> is a <hi>ſpiritual and free ſociety.</hi> I wiſh Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi> could convince all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that dwell within theſe Pariſhes, that therefore they are members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I know nothing but <hi>conſent</hi> that conſtitutes any man a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church; but that we never gave either to the Prieſts impoſed upon us by a Patron, and a Prelate; nor to the <hi>Parochial</hi> Church, as you take Parochial.</p>
               <p>Wherefore upon Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s definition I argue, where there was no union, there can be no Schiſm.</p>
               <p>But between us and your Church there was no union: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Schiſm; why then doth he charge us with it?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Suppoſe we were members, yet ſtill you are to prove there was no <hi>cauſe given</hi> for our ſeparation; which though you attempt to do, yet Sir, you muſt bring other manner of arguments than Rhetorical flouriſhes, and humane ſtories to convince us.</p>
               <p>But one thing more: Why doth he tye up his definition to a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church?</hi> I think a man may hold Communion with that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of which he is a member, and yet both he and that <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church</hi> too, may be guilty of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> So that his definition is too ſtrait. I will give him more advantage, and let him take it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall then give a deſcription of Schiſm, and open it. Then I will lay down ſeveral Propoſitions tending to the clearing of the Queſtion, who are the <hi>true Schiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Schiſm <hi>is a renting or diſſolving that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which Chriſt our Head requireth in his viſible body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To open it, I ſhall be ſhort.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That Chriſt hath a Body <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Myſtical,</hi> or a body in a myſtery, which is to him as his natural body, is known to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 1.22. ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>He is the head over all to the Church,</hi> v. 23. <hi>which is his body.</hi> This Head, and this Body, make up one Chriſt <hi>mystical,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. ſo is Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. This Body of Chriſt is but <hi>one;</hi> two Bodies joined to one Head, much more thouſands, were monſtrous. All the believers in all the particular Churches of the world make up but this <hi>one</hi> Body of Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Eheſ.</hi> 4 4. <hi>one body.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 21. <hi>one Bride, one Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. This body hath its bands or ligaments, whereby the body is tyed to the Head, and the members one to another. For thoſe to the <hi>Head</hi> I omit; the other concern me in this place, how the members are tyed one to another. Now theſe ligaments are firſt <hi>Internal;</hi> ſecondly, are <hi>External.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98093:48"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Internal:</hi> and they, 1. The bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>One body and one ſpirit.</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. The ſecond is <hi>love, Col.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>External</hi> bands are the Sacraments or Seals of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; whether <hi>Government</hi> be any thing, I ſhall touch afterwards.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> they are the bands of this <hi>viſible body;</hi> they belong <hi>only</hi> to the members of this body; <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> Epheſ. 4.5. belong only to that <hi>one body,</hi> v. 4.</p>
               <p>1 Cor. 11.17. <hi>We being many, are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Excommunication,</hi> in which men are cut off the Body, and rendered, <hi>durante hoc ſtatu,</hi> as Heathens and Publicans, not viſible members of Chriſt, is by caſting them out of Communion with their Body in theſe Ordinances. In theſe Ordinances the viſible members of the body declare that unity and internal band of love one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panis igitur fractio eſt unitatis, &amp; dilectionis ſymbolum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Virtute hujus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti, con a leſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num corpus invicem &amp; cum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto.</hi> Par. <hi>in loc.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A Chriſtians love (I ſpeak to the buſineſs in hand) is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Chriſtian love <hi>common to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Chriſtian Eccleſiaſtical love <hi>proper to ſome;</hi> as for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love</hi> I am bound to manifeſt that to the bodies and ſouls of <hi>all,</hi> though Heathens. I will pray with Heathens, (a ſilly thing to turn Excommunicated perſons from <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is <hi>Natural Worſhip</hi>) I will Preach to Heathens; I will exhort, reprove, encourage Heathens privately; to comfort a Heathen as a Chriſtian, I cannot; elſe I call not to mind what effects of love I manifeſt to a Chriſtian, but I will to a Heathen.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Chriſtian Eccleſiaſtical love,</hi> manifeſted by Communion in theſe Symbols or ſigns, I will not manifeſt that to <hi>one</hi> Heathen, only to the members of this viſible body, being one with them.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> and this late Commencer adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would thank either of them if they would give us a ſtout piece againſt <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and his followers.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If by <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government they <hi>mean ſuch</hi> as now is among us, let them firſt prove it is of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> which all the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>Cambridg</hi> or <hi>Oxford</hi> ſhall never be able to do, ſo long as there is a Bible; and if they cannot do that, then where is the <hi>ſchiſm?</hi> It's rather our duty to ſeparate from what is not of Chriſts planting in his houſe.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98093:49"/>
               <p n="3">3ly. But let the Government be of Chriſts Inſtitution, yet wherein doth that Government ſhew it ſelf? among other things in letting in, or caſting out of this body? by admitting or caſting out from theſe Ordinances of the Sacraments? but that refuſing, or ſeparation from <hi>ſuch</hi> Epiſcopal-Government, meerly as <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Mortale ſchiſma,</hi> this is but the figment of the delirant-brain of a Prelatical Zealot.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. This Schiſm is in the <hi>viſible body</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>I hear there are ſchiſms among you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.8. the <hi>houſe of Cloe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.11. <hi>ſaw</hi> them, who informed <hi>Paul.</hi> Schiſm it ſeems comes under the ſenſes, then it muſt be in the <hi>viſible body,</hi> when this body viſibly met together.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>viſible body</hi> of Chriſt I underſtand all that make profeſſion of their Faith in the Lord Jeſus, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſoundly, and do in their converſation viſibly walk according to his Rules in his Goſpel, ſo that their converſation do not openly be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly and deny their profeſſion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>one</hi> body of Chriſt mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. in which there ought to <hi>be no ſchiſm,</hi> v. 25. is meant the <hi>viſible</hi> body of Chriſt, I think none will deny. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp; Epheſ.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſuch a body in which the Lord had <hi>ſet Apoſtles, Evangeliſts,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. ſuch a body to which extraordinary gifts were given. But theſe were Apoſtles; not to one <hi>particular</hi> Church, but the Catholick Church viſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>One member is to ſuffer or rejoice with another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.26. Ay, if it be a member and real member of our particular Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth;</hi> but for other Churches, and unleſs we are ſure they are inviſible members, let them go. Is this the meaning?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are we baptized into a particular, or the Catholick Church? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and Baptiſm belongs to the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Other things I might mention, but I think it will not be denied.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. When then that <hi>union</hi> our Lord and Head requireth in this his viſible body is rent, diſſolved; when Communion is denied among the members of it, contrary to his appointment.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Schiſm</hi> appears, when the internal band, <hi>Love,</hi> is broken, there is ſomething of the nature, the root of the ſin is in it, but that is hid. Men can hypocritically and vilely meet together, and hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Ordinance which holds forth unity and love, and have their hearts wretchedly divided one from another, this may be hid, as I ſaid.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Schiſm</hi> properly ſo called, is when the <hi>external band</hi> is broken; when communion in thoſe ſymbols or ſigns, is denied on one ſide, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed on the other ſide, without warrant from Chriſt; ſo that the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98093:49"/>members do not meet and hold their communion as they ought, but ſplit into ſeveral pieces, oppoſite one to another, as if they were not members of that <hi>one body.</hi> Now <hi>Schiſm</hi> is apparent, <hi>Quia haec ſciſſio maximè perficitur &amp; apparet in debita communione Eccleſiaſtica recuſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, id circo illa ſeparatio, per appropriationem ſingularem recto vocatur,</hi> Schiſma. <hi>Ames Conſc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having opened our deſcription for finding out the <hi>true Schiſmatical Church or Perſons,</hi> let me give the Reader my mind under ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I reaſſume that which I mentioned before, <hi>viz.</hi> the body of Chriſt is but <hi>one;</hi> and that Schiſm is found in the <hi>viſible</hi> body.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. This body being but <hi>one,</hi> hence then, that this one body comes to be divided into ſo many particular Churches, and meeting in ſo many particular places to celebrate the Sacrament, and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt, it is is but accidental, and not eſſential to this body, it being the conſequent of that vaſt number which makes up this <hi>one</hi> body.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Such yet ought to be the Conformity of all theſe particular Churches unto the Goſpel pattern, the Law and Rule of their <hi>Head,</hi> in their <hi>Faith and Doctrine, in their Worſhip and Diſcipline, in their converſation and practiſe,</hi> I may add, and <hi>conſtitutions,</hi> that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the members of this body come, they may manifeſt their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Eccleſiaſtical love</hi> to and with thoſe particular Churches, without any juſt ſcruple or doubt. It being not in the power of any particular Church to vary in the leaſt from that Rule and Pattern their Lord and Head hath given them; for in ſo doing they deny him to be the Head, and make themſelves the <hi>Head.</hi> The Head is to direct.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. If any particular Church ſhall vary from that Pattern, and ſhall <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the members of this body, <hi>conditions of communion</hi> which our Head hath not impoſed, and ſuch as from the light of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we cannot but apprehend as ſinful, and yet will force them to ſubject to ſuch conditions, or elſe no communion; that <hi>impoſing Church is the ſchimatical Church,</hi> and the guilt of <hi>Schiſm</hi> lyes at their door; Let this Impoſition be in <hi>Faith, Worſhip, Diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>Manners.</hi> Let the Church be Papal (if that be a Church), <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptiſtical, Lutheran, Calviniſt,</hi> no matter what, the <hi>Impoſing party</hi> is the Schiſmatick. Why do you, how dare you if you be members of that Head, impoſe that upon the members of his Body, which himſelf hath not? we will not, we muſt not admit any other <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>will</hi> in things which concern him, but his own; if we may admit <hi>three</hi> things which vary from his Rule, we may admit three
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98093:50"/>hundred, and turn him out from being <hi>Head.</hi> A great ſtir there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the power of the Church in <hi>circumſtances</hi> of worſhip: If you mean <hi>inſeparable</hi> circumſtances, ordering them according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule our Head hath given, for the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church, I know no Nonconformiſt ſuch a block as to deny it; but that the things impoſed upon us as conditions of Communion in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as you call it) are ſuch, the former diſcourſe hath ſufficiently proved the contrary. Hence the Church-men of <hi>England</hi> are the Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. It is an irrational thing that the <hi>Impoſers of Conditions</hi> in things belonging to God, ſhould be the <hi>ſole Judges</hi> of the lawfulneſs of their <hi>Impoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is but <hi>one word or Rule</hi> given, to which the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers</hi> and <hi>Impoſed</hi> are ſtrictly bound, and the Impoſed may underſtand that Rule as well and better than the Impoſfers; elſe how the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant party will defend themſelves againſt <hi>Rome</hi> (the Impoſer) I know not; they ſuppoſe they underſtood it better than <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo do you now think.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The Impoſers have <hi>ſin</hi> in them, and may ſin; they are not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;</hi> therefore their Impoſitions muſt be judged by others.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. If Impoſers muſt be <hi>ſole Judges,</hi> and we muſt obey becauſe they impoſe, then never muſt <hi>the people of God obey the call to come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> Apoc. 18.4. for Impoſing-<hi>Babylon</hi> being the ſole Judg, will tell you, her Impoſitions are all lawful, and therefore you muſt obey.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Chriſt our Head no where requires, but rather forbids our holding Communion with that Church which Impoſeth ſuch things as conditions of Communion, which his members cannot ſubject to, but with a <hi>doubtful conſcience,</hi> Rom. 14 23. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat;</hi> but not, if becauſe of doubting he dare not eat.</p>
               <p>That there are ſome ſuch giddy Chriſtians who will find ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt any Church that they cannot communicate with a clear conſcience, though there be no humane invention impoſed, but only what Chriſt himſelf hath appointed, I do not deny; but then let the guilt of Schiſm lye at their door. But as to your <hi>Humane Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> we cannot ſubmit to them, but with a <hi>doubtful conſcience</hi> at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. There is great difference between a Church in which there are ſome corruptions, but no <hi>Impoſition,</hi> and a Church where there is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pöſition of Humane Inventions, not <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Word; with the firſt we would not doubt to communicate, but not with the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Hence for the examples brought againſt us out of the Scripture, where were corrupt Churches, but no command for ſeparation, as under the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98093:50"/>
               <p>It's very true, how could they make a ſeparation there from the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> without going expreſly againſt the Word? Might they erect another Temple? Is there any ſuch <hi>Temple</hi> under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>For thoſe in the New Teſtament:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Their Churches were rightly conſtituted.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Their Paſtors were rightly called.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Their Paſtors ſound in Doctrine; we do not read they were charged with unſoundneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. For outward ſcandalous ſins we read of none in their Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Their members for the major part ſound; though ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members were unſound in Doctrine and converſation, yet they were but few.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. They had Chriſts Order and Diſcipline, as he appointed, to help themſelves againſt thoſe unſound and corrupt members.</p>
               <p>Hence what cauſe was here for ſeparation? what underſtanding man would ſcruple communion with theſe Churches, though there were ſome corruptions? Compare yours and theſe. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Where was this <hi>Impoſition</hi> of Humane Inventions in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God? unleſs ſome few Schiſmaticks in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> we do not find the Churches charged with mixing any thing of <hi>theirs</hi> in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Which of thoſe Churches had ſworn to the Great God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what was amiſs in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and then return to their vomit again?</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. Chriſt our Head may hold communion with his members living in corrupt Impoſing Churches, and yet others of his members that ſee and know theſe corruptions, muſt not hold communion with them; ſtill the Schiſm lyes upon the Impoſer.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Your Spiritual Courts having Excommunicated many gracious and ſincere-hearted Chriſtians, for what cauſe we know; a ſad thing that ſuch a ſolemn Ordinance ſhould be ſo abuſed. But with theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians, Chriſt holds communion we are ſure; and will not your Church therefore hold Communion with them?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Chriſt holds Communion with his people in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Apoc. 18.4. how were they made, and kept his people elſe? muſt we therefore hold Communion with <hi>Babylon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Chriſt holds Communion with his people in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I doubt not; but if they impoſe upon you the Doctrine of the Ubiquity of Chriſts Humane Nature as a condition of Communion, will you hold Communion with them?</p>
               <p n="9">9ly. Perſecution joined to Impoſition upon the members of Chriſts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98093:51"/>body, what Chriſt never impoſed, renders the ſin of the Impoſing-Church much greater; and refuſing Communion with ſuch a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Impoſing Church is no <hi>Schiſm.</hi> If Chriſt doth give us leave to flee from one Perſecuting City to another, where there is no Perſecution, then if a City be a Perſecuting City, by reaſon of a Perſecuting Church, ſurely he doth not bind us to hold Communion with that Perſecuting Church.</p>
               <p n="10">10ly. Though one particular Church cannot communicate with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other particular Church, becauſe of their corrupt Impoſitions, yet if that Church which cannot communicate with the other, will admit of thoſe members of that Church who walk as become Chriſtians in all other points, excepting thoſe Impoſed corruptions which at preſent they cannot ſee, being blinded with thoſe deluding notions of <hi>indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> and <hi>circumſtances,</hi> that Church cannot be charged with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> though they refuſe communion with the <hi>Impoſing</hi> Church; for we give communion to their members, only exclude their impoſed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I do not mean ſuch members as voluntarily took that ſolemn Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of reforming thoſe corruptions, and now return to them again. I look on this as a greater ſin; but for others I know ſeveral of our Churches would give them communion, (I do not ſay <hi>all</hi> will) but then how are we Schiſmaticks?</p>
               <p n="11">11ly. Particular Churches may be ſo corrupt both in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Converſation, that the ſounder members not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought</hi> to ſeparate from them to ſave their own ſouls from infection, and this is not <hi>Schiſm</hi> but <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12ly. The caſe of thoſe who are actual members of thoſe Churches where theſe corruptions are, is different from thoſe who are no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch Churches; they have ſomething elſe to do before they may ſeparate.</p>
               <p n="13">13ly. If it be our ſin to communicate with ſuch as we know to be notoriouſly wicked, unleſs we follow the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſeek the removal of them, or do not our duty to reform the Paſtor,
<note place="margin">Cure of Church-Diviſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 100.</note> or remove him, as Mr. <hi>Baxtar</hi> tells us; How we ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate without ſin, though we had nothing elſe to trouble us, I know not: that many ſuch come to the Sacraments, and who more boldly than they? we know; which way ſhall we reform them? the Curate hath no Juridical power. To the Spiritual Court muſt we go? To the Dioceſan muſt we go? we are like to mend it; carry Witneſſes, how many miles? when yet the power we cannot own to be of Chriſt. When all is done, have a Writ upon our backs to bring us to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and what then?</p>
               <p>Whence to conclude, they have dealt unworthily by us, who bring
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98093:51"/>the old <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> againſt us, to condemn us, as if the ſtate of <hi>this</hi> Church were the ſame with the true Church of <hi>England.</hi>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>AFTER I had finiſhed, I met with a Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>The reaſon of Epiſcopal Inſpection aſſerted, in a Sermon at a Veſitation in</hi> Cambridg, <hi>by</hi> John Templer, <hi>D. D.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope of the Sermon is to prove the <hi>Divine Right of Prelacy over Elders and Congregations.</hi> And that the Author might ſhew himſelf to be a true Son of the Church, he hath given ſufficient proof in every particular. For the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> that is ſo perfect, that he ſaith, <hi>the moſt accuminated Intellect is not able with juſtice to charge it with any error,</hi> p. 18. All then the old Nonconformiſts, <hi>Parker, Ames, Bradſhaw, Cartwright, Richardſon, Didoclavius,</hi> &amp;c. together with the latter Nonconformiſts, who were appointed with others by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to review the Liturgy, and have given an account what things in it were to be corrected; <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo, for ſaying he found in it ſome <hi>Tolerabiles Ineptiae,</hi> are all by this <hi>accuminated</hi> Doctor, dub'd for ſo many Dunces. They muſt be men of higher <hi>Acumens</hi> than theſe, that can find any juſt cauſe againſt it; theſe have ſaid nothing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But whatever be the opinion of this Author, yet Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> a man of an acute Intellect, one of their own, and as great a Zealot once as he can be, confeſſeth when he intended to write in defence of the Diſcipline and Ceremonies, when he read theſe mens Books, he found ſuch arguments in them as were never anſwered, and thereupon layed by his Pen, his judgment being quickly altered; but if you be a perſon of a more <hi>accuminated Intellect,</hi> why did you not anſwer thoſe <hi>dull</hi> fellows, and therein do us a kindneſs, that we might have conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as you?</p>
            <p>He tells the Reader, <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>If this order</hi> (of Prelacy) <hi>had a period, the Diſſenters would never pitch upon any one way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The ſame ſaith the old Gentleman at <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe Diſſenting Proteſtants cannot pitch upon one way. Hence no period muſt be put to the <hi>Papal Government</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. You were very cunning, Sir, to pitch upon the warm ſide of the hedg, thereby to ſave your ſelves from perſecution, and keep your fat Livings; then cry up obedience to Governours; pity the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98093:52"/>Martyrs had no better Intellects to have taken this courſe too, and ſo have ſaved their ſtakes!</p>
            <p n="3">3. If men would lay by their ſelf-intereſts, we might ſooner pitch upon <hi>one</hi> way; but ſo long as <hi>he ſits</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, I look but for little of this unity in the Gentile-Churches.</p>
            <p>But to the main ſcope of his Sermon: Had it been to prove the Divine Right of an <hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes</hi> (or <hi>Primus Presbyter,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls a Biſhop) <hi>with</hi> the Presbytery or Eccleſiaſtical Senate, I ſhould not have been his oppoſer; but it is an <hi>Epiſcopus Princeps,</hi> and that not <hi>with,</hi> but <hi>over</hi> the Presbytery, <hi>ſuperiour in power,</hi> which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for; how ſtrongly proved, we ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p>His Text was, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.36. <hi>Paul ſaid to Barnabas, Let us go again, and viſit our Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Doctor</hi> intended out of this Text to prove <hi>ſuch a Viſitation</hi> as was then when he Preached, and ſo in <hi>England</hi> when Biſhops viſit, I preſume; elſe he deceived <hi>him</hi> to whom he dedicates it, and the four Doctors that Licenſed it. See how the Text will force it.</p>
            <p>The Propoſition or Antecedent is this: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Perſons of extraordinary miſſion, commiſſion, and qualifications</hi> for the office, having by their Preaching converted many people from Heatheniſm to the Faith of Chriſt, gathered them into Churches, and ſet Elders over them. Theſe Elders and Churches being but all young Converts, and through the relicts of corruption in them, and the malice of Satan and his Emiſſaries without them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in danger to miſcarry in Doctrine or manners, theſe <hi>two Apoſtles</hi> go to viſit the Churches, which they had planted.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>one Prelate</hi> but of <hi>ordinary miſſion, commiſſion and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> that never converted one <hi>Church,</hi> (may be not <hi>one perſon</hi> in truth), ſhall have power over many Elders and Congregations where he never Preached; over ſo many, that if he Preached every Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he could not preach once in a year to them; yea ſo many, that if he Preached every day in the year, he could not preach once in a year to them, (ſome Dioceſſes are ſo large.) This conſequent from ſuch an Antecedent, my dull Intellect cannot reach I deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>What might be ſaid, I foreſee, and would have prevented it, but I am in a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> and ſo can only touch things as I paſs.</p>
            <p>Arguments he fetches from three Topicks, to prove the <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of one ſingle perſon over other Elders.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>Reaſon,</hi> p. 23. <hi>Though the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church be built upon a Rock, yet particular Churches are ſubject to Dilapidations,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In matters belonging to the Houſe of God, I thought the <hi>will</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98093:52"/>of him that built the Houſe, and is Lord over it, ſhould firſt have been conſulted: His <hi>will</hi> hath <hi>reaſon</hi> in it, we are ſure; but for <hi>our reaſons,</hi> they will put no end to the debate, for one thinks his reaſon is as good as another, <hi>Quot capita, tot ſententiae</hi> It is <hi>Inſtituted worſhip</hi> we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depending upon the poſitive command of the Law giver. But however I deny your conſequence: And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt.
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Church-Hiſtory, gives ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof.</note> From the woful experience the Church hath found of your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers;</hi> theſe having been as great cauſes of the <hi>Dilapidations,</hi> as any other. That Biſhops have been both great Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell you. What woful work theſe have made in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in our time, we do ſtill remember; but I will ſpare names, let them alone in their graves. <hi>Muſculus</hi> (not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nonconformiſt) from the experience the Church had found of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs it ſuffered by theſe <hi>Repairers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Muſc.</hi> loc. Commun. p. 195.</note> ſound out to prevent and heal <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, ſaith, <hi>Had</hi> Hierom <hi>lived to theſe days to ſee how this counſel of ſetting up the Biſhop above the Presbyter hath profited the Church, he would have acknowledged it was not the counſel of the Holy Ghoſt to take away Schiſm, as was pretended, but the counſel of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, &amp;c.</hi> Thus he, with much more he adds.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. There are other means to repair, without ſuch Prelacy, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath proved in ſeveral Churches, where Hereſie and Schiſm have either been kept out, or healed when crept in; Profaneneſs ſuppreſſed better than ever it was in <hi>England</hi> by Prelacy.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. That one Prelate is as ſubject to corruption in Doctrine, and converſation, as other Miniſters; and who ſhall repair him? the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters being inferior to him, they muſt not be ſo ſawcy; that kind of Creature whom you call the Metropolitan, is as ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other Prelate.</p>
            <p>As to the proof you give, <hi>p.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>There is a greater probability of an union of judgments, when all within a certain precinct lye under an obligation to be determined by the reaſon of one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I thank you for this, ſaith the now Pope <hi>Innocent;</hi> this helps to ſtrengthen my old worm-eaten Chair, weak in the joints, and ready to crack. Hereſie and Schiſm muſt be avoided in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> as well as in the Church in your <hi>Precinct;</hi> but if the Biſhops in your ſeveral Precincts differ in their Judgments about Hereſie and Schiſm as they have done, and will do, now <hi>what more probable way for union of Judgments, than to have them lye under an obligation to be determined by the reaſon of one;</hi> and who ſhould that <hi>one</hi> be, but my ſelf? this is but the ſame reaſon that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath given for <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. In one Dioceſs are ſome hundreds of Elders, all having the power of Juriſdiction <hi>ex aquo</hi> from Chriſt, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98093:53"/>hath proved; but however, if this Doctor deny it, among theſe there may be many as godly men, of as ſolid reaſon and judgment, as is this <hi>one Prelate,</hi> yea it may be excel him in all, and in years his Elder too; yet all theſe muſt have their reaſons and judgments ſubject to the determination of the reaſon of that <hi>one Prelate.</hi> I ſhall not applaud him for a man of an <hi>accuminated Intellect,</hi> that ſhall aſſert ſuch an irrational Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſecond Topick <hi>is Gods Declaration for the perpetuity of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Government,</hi> which was over other Elders and Congregations, <hi>p.</hi> 28. Yea, Sir, this is of moment, if you can carry it.</p>
            <p>Firſt Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teach, baptize, inſtruct all Nations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whatſoever was commanded them</hi> I pray add this, <hi>And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to teach That one Prelate, while the Church ſtands, ſhould have ſuperior power over other Elders and Congregations,</hi> then you do ſomething.</p>
            <p>Becauſe you mention <hi>commands</hi> for Government, name two or three Texts to ſtop the mouths of theſe <hi>Eraſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the Text. It is not for nothing that our Lord while he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Teaching, Baptizing,</hi> and under this the Lords Supper; yet ſaith nothing of <hi>Government.</hi> Surely he had a reaſon for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I yield from the Apoſtles and other Elders, Government recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Scripture, that Government belongs to the Elderſhip (with the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> leave) but from hence to infer that becauſe the Apoſtles did exerciſe power over other Elders, <hi>Ergo,</hi> now one Prelate over other Elders: I ſhall deny the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>For, 1. you tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 25. <hi>It's true the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction whereby they were qualified for it, was not of the vulgar compoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſay I, the Unction theſe Prelates have, is but of the <hi>vulgar compoſition.</hi> Hence to argue from <hi>extraordinary</hi> to <hi>ordinary,</hi> is a kind of fallacy, a kin to <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>They that exerciſe Government over other Governours (as all Elders are) had need be in Wiſdom, Learning, Holineſs, and fitneſs for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as <hi>Saul</hi> among his brethren, higher by head and ſhoulders; ſo were the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above thoſe Elders over whom they exerciſed Authority. We find no ſuch things amongſt the men of the <hi>vulgar <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe <hi>Elders,</hi> as well as the people, were the Apoſties <hi>Converts:</hi> theſe being but newly brought home to the Faith, well may their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> have power over them, and cauſe enough to viſit them; the caſe is not ſo here.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. When the Apoſtles come to deal with the ordinary Elders, there is no intimation left of any ſuch power of one Prelate over the reſt. You tell us <hi>p.</hi> 45. that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Ordained Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:98093:53"/>about the 13th. year of <hi>Claudius.</hi> I hope you will not force it from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>As I beſought thee to abide ſtill at</hi> Epheſus. He muſt have an illuminated Intellect indeed, who can force the ordination of a Biſhop out of theſe words. Beſides, certainly had he been Biſhop there, <hi>Paul</hi> need not have <hi>beſought</hi> him to be <hi>reſident</hi> there; but however ſure I am, he muſt be ordained before <hi>Pauls</hi> journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Acts 20. for he tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.14. <hi>he hoped to come unto him ſhortly,</hi> but <hi>Act.</hi> 20.25. when he ſent for the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he tells them <hi>they ſhall ſee his face no more.</hi> If <hi>Timothy</hi> then were Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, then he was there now, and was now ſent for, which I ſhall never believe, that <hi>Paul</hi> would not mention him in particular, whoſe Name he uſes to joyn with his in ſeveral Epiſtles. But if <hi>Timothy</hi> did come with the other Elders, here is no difference made of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late from the other Elders, but 28. <hi>ver.</hi> he gives the ſame alike to them all. Therefore I deny your Conſequence. If <hi>Timothy</hi> were Biſhop of <hi>pheſus,</hi> what need <hi>Paul</hi> tell him, in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle to him,</hi> Chap. 4.12. <hi>Tychicus I have ſent to Epheſus?</hi> he might have ſpared that line, for <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt needs know it, if he came to him there.</p>
            <p>But you add, for a further Confirmation, <hi>p.</hi> 28. the words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> But <hi>the Commiſſion of Chriſt as an Apoſtle, did undoubtedly extend to a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency over the Clergy, and the particle</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>juſtifie the ſame, as to the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A. Undoubtedly Chriſts Commiſſion did extend as you ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limiting it to any <hi>precincts,</hi> which you tell us ſeveral times the Apoſtles were, and eſpecially in <hi>p.</hi> 6. you would labour to prove it from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. [Though that Text I conceive will not do it.] But if the particle <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will force their ſuperintendency over the Clergy, it will as well force it, without limitation to ſuch <hi>precincts;</hi> for his Father did not <hi>ſo</hi> ſend him, and how their Commiſſion runs, we read. But I ſhall not give my thoughts about this now; you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. <hi>that among the Biſhops, Peter leads the Van in the Church of</hi> Antioch. [Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> this does not make for you: I pray tell us in your next, in which Church did <hi>Paul</hi> lead the <hi>Van</hi> among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.] But if <hi>Peter</hi> were Biſhop at <hi>Antioch,</hi> indeed <hi>Paul</hi> went beyond his Precinct, when he dealt ſo roundly with a Biſhop in his own See, as he did with this Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Gal. 2.11.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. I conceive you ſtretch this Text beyond the intent of our Lord. For the work which our Lord undertook, he had a Call from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſent him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. and 10.36. His Father had Authority to ſend him, and was with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32. So he the Head and King of his Church, <hi>having all power given to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98093:54"/>and in Earth, Math.</hi> 28.18. had Authority to ſend forth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to their work; they might ſhow their Commiſſions, or Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. He promiſed alſo to be with them and their Succeſſors to the end: and I think all Goſpel-Miniſters are their Succeſſors: but that the Lord intended in theſe words the ſetling of a Superiority of one perſon above his brethren in the Miniſtry to the end of the world this is but <hi>Petitio pincipii,</hi> your gloſs, and I deny it, for the Reaſons and Scriptures before mentioned.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. Thoſe Apoſtles had Superiority over Biſhops, if there were ſuch then, as you ſay there were, yea, Arch-Biſhops; who is now over them?</p>
            <p>His third Text is <hi>Eph</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Apoſtles were given and their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fregans</hi> [as you call them] <hi>Prophets and Evangeliſts, for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints,</hi> hence <hi>pag.</hi> 30. you conclude, for the duration of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Evangeliſts to this day.</p>
            <p>Thus then we have to this day <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> in the ſenſe of this Text [unleſs he will abuſe the Text:] a rare ſight: I would go many miles to ſee ſuch perſons; and to their Superiority willingly ſubmit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin, Gerhard, Beza, Zanchi, the Leyden Profeſſors,</hi> &amp;c. tell us theſe were <hi>Miniſtri extraordinarii &amp; Temporarii;</hi> but they were men of no <hi>Acuminated Intellects,</hi> their judgements ſignifie little.</p>
            <p>Well Sir, what Apoſtles were, you tell us not, neither need you, we know them well: but where you can find ſuch, I know not: but ſuch you muſt find, if your proof hold.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Prophets</hi> you tell us, <hi>they were ſuch as had an excellent skill to preach the Goſpel out of the Books of the Old Teſtament,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. <hi>Evangelical Doctrines locked up in the Figures of the Law, and Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this were all, we ſhall find many ſuch Prophets amongſt the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts. But, Sir, you have ſpoken very ſhort of the Prophets; <hi>Dr. Hammond, Zanchy,</hi> and <hi>Gerhard,</hi> add two things more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A foretelling things to come.</hi> 2ly. <hi>They ſpake all from the Spirit,</hi> from a Divine Afflatus. Theſe three are ſomewhat like, I pray ſhew us theſe Prophets now.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evangelists</hi> you tell us, are ſuch <hi>as had a profound inſight into the Goſpel, as contained in the Writings of the New-Teſtament: and could with ſingular dexterity open and explain its true importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such there are alſo amongſt the Nonconformiſts.</p>
            <p>But Sir, what if there were Evangeliſts, before there was any part of the New-Teſtament <hi>writtens</hi> how then does your deſcription agree?</p>
            <p>I queſtion not, if the Ancients ſay true of the time when <hi>John</hi> wrote
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98093:54"/>his Goſpel, but <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Evangeliſt long before: and in that Goſpel are the deep Myſteries contained, more than in the other three. If the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> were the firſt Epiſtle that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, as Divines generally think, <hi>Timothy</hi> is joyned with <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> ſo that very little was written when he firſt was made an Evangeliſt; I ſee by ſome of your own, and thoſe Learned men, <hi>Philip</hi> was an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> when he preached the Goſpel at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and wrought Miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.5, 6, 7. but at that time no part of the New Teſtament was written. For <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote firſt, and that was eight years after the Aſcenſion as our Divines for the generality of them agree.</p>
            <p>But for the <hi>Evangelists, Euſebius,</hi> l. 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. a fitter man to tell us what an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> was, than you, gives us another deſcription, and that which agrees with <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.5, 6, 7. and other Scriptures; I ſhall note only theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they watered the Churches, every where planted by the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They preached Chriſt to them, which as yet heard not of the Doctrine of Christ</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Having planted the Faith in new and ſtrange places, they ordained there other Paſtors, committing to them the Tillage of the new ground, preſſing themſelves to other People and Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By the power of the Holy Ghost they wrought miraculouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Show us theſe <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> now.</p>
            <p>His laſt Text is, 1 Tim. 6.14. <hi>Keep the Commandments until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A. 1. By the <hi>appearing</hi> of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. exitus vitae</hi> is meant, thinks <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſome others. But if not, yet this <hi>appearing</hi> is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument uſed not only to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but to all Chriſtians, to look to their duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What <hi>Commandment</hi> this was, if we well obſerve the 11. and 13. <hi>ver.</hi> going before, we may well gueſs</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you refer it to his <hi>Office</hi> as you do, and would thence infer the perpetuity of his <hi>Office</hi> to the Worlds end: I deny that to be the meaning.</p>
            <p>For, when the Apoſtle charges him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>do the work of an Evangelist,</hi> &amp;c. there the word <hi>Evangelist</hi> is taken in the ſame ſenſe with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 11. not only <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Gerhard,</hi> but <hi>Scultetus,</hi> though an Epiſcopal man, yieldeth, and it were abſurd to think otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Timothy</hi> in the 1. <hi>Epiſtle Chap.</hi> 1.3. ſhould be ordained a Biſhop as you ſay, and long after this charged to do the work of an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> they muſt have <hi>dull Intellects</hi> indeed, that know nothing of an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and a Biſhop who beelieve it: The <hi>Evangelist</hi> being one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98093:55"/>fixed to no place, and had the power of Miracles, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and the Scriptures teſtifie.</p>
            <p>This was a Commandment ſo incumbent upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> that his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or miſcarrying was concerned in it, as he performed it, and ſo it is true of all Miniſters; but for an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> the <hi>French Church,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Scotland, New-England,</hi> [where Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> hath more right of Superiority over the Churches of the Indians, than any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the World, yet would deteſt your Doctrine] nor any Churches that I know of, own an <hi>Evangelist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As yet then the proof fails. Thus we find in <hi>Clemens Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a <hi>Metropolitan Church</hi> (forſooth) there is no mention made of any ſuch Prelate. But <hi>pag.</hi> 2.62, 69. and 73. eſpecially, he mentions only <hi>Elders</hi> without any diſtinction. A Biſhop being but <hi>Primus Presbyter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Primi Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur,</hi> Ambroſ. <hi>in</hi> 4 Eph.</note> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls him, it may ſtand with <hi>Epiſcopus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Thus <hi>Polycarpus</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Philippi,</hi> another <hi>Metropolis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dr. Hammond;</hi> there is no menion of any ſuch <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> but <hi>pag.</hi> 18. he exhorts them to be ſubject to the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> anſwering to <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Timothy's being twice ordained,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. which you would have underſtood of Prophets, <hi>&amp;c p.</hi> 45, 46.</p>
            <p>What you aim at, in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s twice Ordination, I know not; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>we</hi> may be twice ordained, though firſt by Presbyters: let it firſt be proved that <hi>Timothy</hi> was twice ordained to the <hi>ſame</hi> Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timothy first ordained by the Apoſtle himſelf, you ſay,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. I pray Sir to what Office? ſay, and prove from Divine Writ.</p>
            <p>If the ſecond time ordained, not to an inferiour Office I hope; the firſt Ordination by an Apoſtle, the ſecond to a higher Office by Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers. I pray when was he ordained an <hi>Evangeliſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does your notion of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, take, to be meant of any other <hi>Prophets</hi> different from <hi>Paul;</hi> for we know that <hi>Paul</hi> excelled in <hi>all gifts,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.18. as of <hi>Tongues,</hi> ſo no queſtion of <hi>Propheſie.</hi> Why therefore <hi>Paul</hi> might not be <hi>He</hi> to whom the Spirit revealed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Timothy;</hi> as yet ſo young, and ſo to take him along for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, give us a Reaſon, for it ſeems there was a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> given, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14 <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>. That the Apoſtles did convey <hi>gifts</hi> we know, by their impoſing of hands; though the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery</hi> joyned with the Apoſtle in his <hi>Ordination;</hi> and ſo I know not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>One</hi> Ordination that ever <hi>Timothy</hi> had, and that to an <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His third and laſt Topick to prove the Superiority of this Prelate is, the <hi>practiſe of the univerſal Church,</hi> pag. 42. To which add his ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. <hi>As for Prelacy; [the Eſſence whereof lyes in a Superiority of an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98093:55"/>Eccleſiaſtical perſon over Elders in a certain precinct]: it was ever owned by the Church as agreeable to the Canon of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, did you deliver this in the Pulpit, for a Truth, where be ſure no man ought to ſpeak any thing but Truth?</p>
            <p>Have not you read <hi>Auſtins</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Hierom, Epiſtle</hi> 18. in which <hi>Auſtin</hi> writes thus to him, <hi>Quanquam enim ſecundum honorum Vocabula quae jam</hi> Eccleſiae uſus <hi>obtinuit Epiſcopatus Presbyterio major eſt,</hi> &amp;c. Surely you have read <hi>Hieroms</hi> Comment upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſcopi noverint ſe magis</hi> conſuetudine, <hi>quam</hi> Diſpoſitionis Dominicae <hi>veritate Presbyteris eſſe majores.</hi> To which A. B. <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſubſcribes, in his Comment on the ſame Chapter. What Sir, is <hi>Eccleſiae uſus</hi> and <hi>Conſuetudo,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Canon of Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have not you read <hi>Eſtius, Sent.</hi> l. 4. d. 24. calling thoſe Hereticks that are not of your Opinion, and undertaking to prove the <hi>jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of Prelacy as you do? he ſaith thus. <hi>Quod autem</hi> jure Divino <hi>ſint Epiſcopi Presbyteris Superiores,</hi> &amp; ſi non ita clarum eſte ſacris Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>aliunde tamen ſatis efficaciter probari poteſt.</hi> Have you not read what <hi>Medina</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this point; and what our Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> naming the ſame Fathers that <hi>Medina</hi> did, adds, <hi>Paul himſelf muſt be a Heretick if Biſhop and Presbyter be not the ſame according to the Scriptures.</hi> Much more I might add, that I wonder you could write ſuch a line.</p>
            <p>And what Sir, will you exclude all thoſe Churches from being parts of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that have not, nor do own your Prelacy? or what Church do you mean, when you ſay the <hi>Church hath owned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſo many of the Church were of your Opinion, this with your <hi>Metropolitan Arch-Biſhop</hi> brought that Whore in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. to her Chair, without which that Prophecy had not been fulfilled to this day, ſo that though it is not true what you ſay, yet if it had been true, it had not much prevailed with me: but God hath left Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, both in his Word, and in the Church.</p>
            <p>As for your notion, <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>The reaſon why the Apoſtles wrote to the Churches that were in the cities which were Metropoles, was to ſhew that all the Churches which were in that Province did depend upon that Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis Government; and this Biſhop was an Archbiſhop,</hi> p. 50.</p>
            <p>I pray, Sir, which of the Apoſtles told you this was their reaſon? or where do you find this written?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle mentions but but one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. This notion I ſee you are ſo taken with, that <hi>p.</hi> 51. you tell us, this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis <hi>gives the moſt intelligible account why all the Churches in</hi> Aſia <hi>are reduced to Seven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Intelligible account</hi> then we have of <hi>that,</hi> which I had a deſire to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98093:56"/>know; but becauſe the Lord had hidden it, it became not me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after his ſecrets; but now we have a reaſon why <hi>all</hi> the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> are reduced to Seven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I pray, Sir, give us (ſince you are ſo acquainted with Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets) an <hi>Intelligible account,</hi> why, ſince there were ſo many Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> and thoſe Churches in the Metropoles, yet the Lord writes not to one of them in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> only to <hi>Aſia?</hi> Was not <hi>Rome</hi> a Metropoles, and there a Church?</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Are you ſure theſe were all Metropoles? It ſeems there is ſome queſtion about <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and your ſolution does not ſatisfie. So for <hi>Thyatira,</hi> it ſeems <hi>Pliny</hi> doth not give it this honour, but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> doth. So that we muſt reſt upon a <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> and prove which of theſe was the trueſt Writer.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. But are you ſure there were no more Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> than fell under the ſeven Archbiſhops? Which of theſe was Archbiſhop to the Churches in <hi>Galatia?</hi> that was a Province in <hi>Aſia;</hi> but none of theſe Cities Metropolis there, for <hi>Ancyra</hi> was. <hi>Antioch</hi> a Metropolis then under none of theſe, yet there a Church. To which I pray did <hi>Coloſſe</hi> belong? <hi>Cappadocia, Pontus, Bithinia,</hi> were all Provinces in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in theſe were Churches no doubt, for the Apoſtle writing to the Believers in theſe Provinces, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. in the 5th Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>He charges the Elders to feed the flock.</hi> Yet none of the <hi>ſeven</hi> Churches were <hi>Metropoles</hi> in any of theſe Provinces. I could inſtance in divers more.</p>
            <p>This I ſuppoſe the <hi>Doctor</hi> Preached to make amends for the fault he committed in being ordained firſt by Presbyters; for now he talks of Archbiſhops in the Apoſtles days; whereas Mr. <hi>Thorndike, pag.</hi> 45. <hi>Prim. Gov.</hi> and the old Epiſcopal men tell us, Archbiſhops came in long after.</p>
            <p>As for your diſcourſe from <hi>p.</hi> 60. to the end, in which you tell your Reader ſomething concerning Rules about <hi>Order, Decency, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials in Religion. Adiaphorus</hi> matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what the Church may do to preſerve it ſelf againſt oppoſers, that thereby <hi>p.</hi> 62. you might juſtifie the puniſhment inflicted upon us for our Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Sir, this is but the old Cheat to blind the people, as if we oppoſed <hi>Order, Decency,</hi> and <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> in Religion; and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted, will you juſtifie it that Governours may for every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in things pertaining to God, puniſh their people for not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them, as we are puniſhed? but how much leſs then for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming to <hi>Humane Inventions</hi> in the Worſhip of God? which as yet all the Pulpits and Preſſes have not proved to be our error, (I mean our <hi>non conformity</hi> to them) but our Duty.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98093:56"/>
            <p>And for that which <hi>p.</hi> 61. you would bring as a proof, <hi>viz. That the Churches Determination upon ſome particu ars, in conformity to the general command, is no addition to the Rule, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, if there be a <hi>conformity to the general command;</hi> but if you will undertake, (as here you implicitely aſſert) to prove that the <hi>Forms of Prayer, Ceremonies, Prelacy, Re-ordination, Abjuration of the Covenant</hi> (all which are impoſed upon us) are all of them but <hi>particulars conformable to the general command of God;</hi> Sir, let us but have the liberty of the Preſs, and you ſhall ſoon find one that will anſwer you. I ſuppoſe there are but few pious Conformiſts in <hi>England</hi> that will juſtifie the caſting of about two thouſand Miniſters out of their work, becauſe they could not ſubmit to theſe Impoſitions in the matters of God; had it been in things concerning the Commonwealth, that had been another caſe, then let him blame us. Whence we are quite miſtaken in Dr. <hi>Templer.</hi>

            <p>THE former pages were printed off ſooner than I was aware of; but give me leave to add theſe lines to clear my ſelf from that ſin of <hi>Schiſm</hi> which which you charge me among my Brethren, a little further; ſince I ſtill continue the ſame love and honourable reſpects to you.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> Three caſes there are you tell us, p. 213. in which the Sripture allows of Separation, 1. <hi>Idolatrous worſhip.</hi> 2. <hi>Falſe doctrine impoſed.</hi> 3. <hi>Indifferent things made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation</hi> [of this latter one word by and by]. <hi>But there are two others wherein</hi> Paul <hi>gives particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, but ſuch as do not amount to ſeparation,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions about</hi> meats and drinks, <hi>obſervation of</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Holy-days. <hi>In theſe points he adviſes not to cenſure one another,</hi> but notwithſtanding this difference, join together as Chriſtians in the duties common to them all.</q> 
               <hi>Thus you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Sir, This is very true: accordingly as I meet with Chriſtians of different apprehenſions, <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Independent, Anabaptiſts</hi> (ſome few of which I have found, ſober men, and ſound in all points but that), let theſe men be ſound in the faith, and walk with a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſation, ſubjecting to Church government, though in their different ways, I give the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to them <hi>all,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing communion with none for theſe opinions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But my good Brother, are you not beſide the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98093:58"/>
               <hi>Did they in thoſe duties which were common to them all as Chriſtians, impoſe ſuch things as the Lord never impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as terms of Communion?</hi> This is our caſe, both in <hi>Prayer, Baptiſm, Lords Supper, Diſcipline, which are duties common to us all;</hi> in all theſe you impoſe your <hi>own inventions,</hi> not our <hi>Lords injunctions;</hi> ſo did not they.</p>
            <p>And what if they would impoſe their <hi>Jewiſh Holydays</hi> (which yet were once <hi>Gods own</hi> appointment) upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to obſerve them, who knew they were abrogated? Sir, you impoſe <hi>Holydays of mens appointing</hi> upon us, which is far worſe; God's Authority is higher than yours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing you mention, is the <hi>corrupt lives of men in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. where you explain 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>No, not to eat;</hi> but Sir, I prefer your <hi>Hammond</hi>'s explication, to which I refer the <hi>Reader;</hi> ſee his Pararaph and his Notes.</p>
            <p>As to that third ground which may warrant Separation, you ſay, viz. <hi>The impoſing of things indifferent as neceſſary to our ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Sir, is <hi>our ſalvation</hi> all that we ſhould regard? Is not the <hi>glory and honour of God</hi> a thing to be attended? Is not this glory and honour of his, the firſt thing to be intended in his Worſhip? Is it not his honour when his <hi>Soveraignty and Wiſdom</hi> alone commands in his Worſhip? In caſe he be deprived of his Worſhip, is this honour to him? Sir, you make your Inventions, though in themſelves indifferent, yet being commanded by mans Authority, <hi>to alter in ſome ſort their natures</hi> (they are the words of your Canon upon the Croſs) and ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> you make them, that <hi>without theſe</hi> God ſhall have no worſhip at all.

            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> which you impoſe, you tell us, p. 332. you will ſay nothing, Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi> having ſo well defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I know it is imputed to our <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>conceitedneſs of our own gifts,</hi> that we uſe it not. Sir, I do profeſs in words of ſobriety, if you, or Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi> can aſſure me infulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98093:58"/>that I ſhould be pleaſing to God, and that I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Office as I ought, only by reading <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer, I will be as <hi>ready</hi> to uſe nothing but <hi>Forms,</hi> as you are <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>reſolute</hi> to impoſe them; I would uſe alſo that <hi>Form</hi> of prayer <hi>before my Sermon,</hi> which your 55th <hi>Canon</hi> does <hi>command to be uſed before Sermon;</hi> and ſo nothing but <hi>Forms,</hi> which is the ſenſe of your Church. I ſay, may I be but as pleaſing to God. My reaſon is, I obſerve it would very much pleaſe my <hi>corrupt, lazy, unbelieving</hi> heart. I ſhould not need then to beg of God the preſence of his Spirit to help me as to the <hi>matter</hi> of prayer; nor need I act my faith and dependance upon him as conſcious of my own <hi>inſufficiency,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. for all my prayer is prepared to a ſyllable. I ſhould not then labour with my proud heart to ſubmit quietly to Gods pleaſure, though he doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, and not afford that preſence ſometimes, which he doth at other times. For here are the ſame words and ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables at all times, his abſence or preſence hath no room here. It may be the <hi>Friendly Debater</hi> that can jeer, I ſee, at <hi>Chriſtian experiences,</hi> will jeer at me too, becauſe I give this experience of my corrupt heart; but I care not.</p>
            <p>As for Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> let but the Queſtion be truly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and I do not find one Scripture-argument he hath brought that concludes the Queſtion: for his <hi>own humane</hi> reaſons, I little regard them in <hi>divine Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for private Chriſtians, I know your Clergy look on them as the Phariſees did upon the vulgar, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.49. but, Sir, I know more of them than <hi>you,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Falkner;</hi> plain Mechanicks have I known well Catechiſed, and humble Chriſtians excellent in practical piety, kept their ſtation, did not aſpire to be Preachers, but for gifts of prayer, few Clergy-men muſt come near them. I profeſs I fall ſhort of them. I have known ſome of them when they did keep their Faſts (as they did often) they divided the work of Prayer; the firſt began with <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> the ſecond went on with <hi>Petition</hi> for <hi>themſelves;</hi> the third Petition for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98093:59"/>
               <hi>Church and Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> the fourth. <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> every one kept to his own part, and did not meddle with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part. Such excellent matter ſo compacted without Tautologies, each of them for a good time, about an hour, if not more apiece, to the wondering of thoſe who joyned with them. Such anſwers of prayer I have known to others, that they have praiſed God for aſſurance that he had heard them before they roſe off their knees, and at that time it was done; a thing of very great conſequence, but heard not of it till two days after. Here was no reading of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies; theſe were old <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons, could wreſtle and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God; and yet muſt be puniſhed if they came not to Church, and ſet above an hour in the cold to hear a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter read that which their boys could do at home: and bleſſed be God that <hi>England</hi> in this dark day hath many thouſands of ſuch plain, but praying Chriſtians, however deſpiſed and puniſhed.</p>
            <p>As for that Queſtion, <hi>Whether every particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes a particular Church?</hi> which you deny, and oppoſe the Diſſenters, p. 234. &amp;c. I pray, Sir, why do you not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi>'s Text which he brings p. 45. from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. compared with 20. that Text deſerves an anſwer; and till that be done, they are not confuted; you have left out the ſtrongeſt Argument.</p>
            <p>Sir, you muſt ſtate the Queſtion a little cloſer, elſe you will not carry it. I doubt not but there may be one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation which may be inveſted with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and execute all the power of the keys, and I think that is a Church. For inſtance, take your <hi>own</hi> Congregation, and a few more in <hi>London,</hi> where four or five thouſand meet to worſhip God, ſo large are your places, with Galleries alſo. I would ſuppoſe in ſuch a Congregation there would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired four <hi>Teaching</hi> Elders, four <hi>Ruling</hi> Elders (Sir, I muſt own that Officer, though I think there hath been an error in aſſigning him that power which is not due to him) and four <hi>Deacons.</hi> Let all theſe Officers ply their work as hard
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98093:59"/>as they will, I doubt not but they will find their hands full and hearts full too, unleſs the Four thouſand be the better Chriſtians. But Sir, will you deny this Congregation to be ſuch a Church as we read of in the Goſpel, compleat as to exerciſe of all the power of the keys? I am ſure you will not.</p>
            <p>As for your Reaſon for <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> [another ground of difference between us] which you give us in your <hi>Preface,</hi> pag. 5. quoting Mr. <hi>Noyes of New-England</hi> in your Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 234. agreeing with you, <hi>viz. It is hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade conſidering men, that the Christian Church ſhould dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſo ſoon, ſo unanimouſly, ſo univerſally,</hi> &amp;c.—Mr. <hi>Noyes— Would not Elders, ſo many knowing men, at leaſt ſome of them have contended for Truth, wherein their own Liberties were ſo much intereſſed?</hi> Aerius <hi>his oppoſing of Biſhops ſo long after their riſe and ſtanding, is inconſiderable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sir, much here might be ſaid, but I leave it to thoſe, with whom you have to deal; as for Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> I know him very well, and know what may cauſe him to write for Epiſcopal Government. That <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (bear with my words, for I am ſure it is contrary to Scripture and Reaſon) of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational men, <hi>That the Fraternity</hi> (or <hi>Plebs) is the firſt ſubject of the power of the keys,</hi> have made ſuch work in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches to my knowledg, that their Elders have felt the need of that principle, and made them to think again.</p>
            <p>But good Brother, what Epiſcopacy is it you mean? if you mean only <hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes,</hi> I am of your opinion, it was the government in the Apoſtles time when Elders in a particular Church were multiplied: And if we would but exerciſe more meekneſs and patience one with another, Conſult the Scriptures more attentively, we ſhall find that the true Government and Conſtitution of the Church takes in ſomthing of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſomthing of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> ſomething of <hi>Independency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, if you mean <hi>Epiſcopus Princeps,</hi> (which is <hi>our</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98093:60"/>Caſe) one that hath a Superiority of power above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> with which <hi>theſe</hi> muſt not meddle, and this Biſhop ſuch large <hi>Dioceſs</hi> as <hi>ours</hi> are, and this Biſhop alſo the <hi>Sole Paſtor</hi> over the Dioceſs, as Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> checking Mr. <hi>Baxter, tells him, that the Biſhop of</hi> Worceſter, <hi>and not</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter, is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of</hi> Kidderminſter, <hi>as well as of all other</hi> Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>in that Dioceſs,</hi> pag. 2. Sir, this <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> you and Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> have to prove, that it was ever in the Apoſtles time, or of Chriſts Inſtitution, for this we utterly deny.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preſidential Epiſcopacy</hi> (as I may term it) laſted, as it is conceived by Learned men, till the middle of the ſecond Century, or towards the end of it: your ſelf does not deny it. <hi>Iren.</hi> pag. 275, 276.</p>
            <p>But for this <hi>Princely Epiſcopacy,</hi> when that began to be ſet up, then began the Degeneracy of the Apoſtolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Though Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> makes little of <hi>Aerius,</hi> yet <hi>Medina</hi> tells the world that <hi>Jerome, Auſtin, Ambroſe, Sedulius, Primaſius, Chryſoſtom, Theodore, Theophilacct,</hi> were all of <hi>Aerins</hi> his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and you ſay <hi>Medinas</hi> judgment will prove true, <hi>Iren.</hi> 276. So ſay <hi>Biſhop Jewel</hi> and Learned <hi>Whitaker. Quam</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius <hi>frigidiſſimis rationibus refellit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Tom. 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 149.</p>
            <p>As for their <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi> beſide what I have ſaid before, <hi>you</hi> tell us they were not very large, <hi>ſince all the Pariſhes could communicate on the ſame day with what was ſent from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church. Iren.</hi> pag. 370. Sure I am what you plead for now, does not agree with the laſt Paragraph of your <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> where you were nearer the Truth.</p>
            <p>How they ſhould come to degenerate ſo ſoon, is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood if we believe the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4, and 7. <hi>ver.</hi> and the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> If <hi>poſitâ permiſſione infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſequitur quod permittitur,</hi> which I am ſure is true; then it is as true, if the <hi>Spirit</hi> foretels what ſhall come to paſs, that muſt come to paſs. good <hi>Auſtni,</hi> good <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other good Biſhops, by their Superiority of power and large Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98093:60"/>did prepare the way for wicked <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, and he made the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> his Dioceſs: it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him elſe to come there, had the Churches kept to the Apoſtolical Government.</p>
            <p>That Counſel and prediction of God was ſecretly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely brought about by men.
